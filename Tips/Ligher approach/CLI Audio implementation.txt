The file cli_audio.py is a more advanced CLI script for audio-only TTS. It allows you to:

- Enter text via command line argument, file, or prompt.
- Specify the TTS API endpoint URL and output file name.
- Optionally play the audio after generation.
- Includes error handling and flexible options.

It is useful if you want more control over how you input text, where you send requests, and how you handle output, compared to the very simple `cli_audio_simple.py`.

**Summary:**
- `cli_audio_simple.py`: Minimal, direct text-to-speech.
- `cli_audio_openai.py`: OpenAI chat + TTS.
- cli_audio.py: Advanced CLI with more options and flexibility.

You can keep all three for different use cases!




# Audio CLI Guide

This guide explains how to use the audio-only CLI tools for generating speech from text and interacting with OpenAI in your terminal.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install required packages:
  ```sh
  pip install requests python-dotenv openai
  ```
- Ensure your FastAPI TTS server is running:
  ```sh
  python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```

## Basic Audio CLI: `cli_audio_simple.py`
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python cli_audio_simple.py
   ```
2. Enter text when prompted.
3. The script will generate a WAV file and play it back using `aplay`.

## OpenAI Interactive Audio CLI: `cli_audio_openai.py`
1. Make sure your `.env` file contains your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python cli_audio_openai.py
   ```
3. Type your prompt in the terminal.
4. The script will:
   - Send your prompt to OpenAI (ChatGPT)
   - Print the AI's response
   - Synthesize the response to audio and play it back
   - Save each audio file with a timestamped filename

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, run `pip install` as above.
- If you hear no sound, check your system volume and confirm the WAV file is not silent (open in Audacity).
- If you get connection errors, make sure your FastAPI server is running and accessible at `localhost:8000`.

## Customization
- You can change the TTS API URL in the script if your server runs on a different host/port.
- Audio files are saved with timestamps for easy organization.

so we can create another cli for audio or just use the test_tts api to gen
 audio for production. 
i mean that i have integration with open ai and uvicorn!!


You can use your existing test_tts_api.py as a base for production audio generation, or create a more 
robust CLI script for audio-only output. Since you already have integration with OpenAI and Uvicorn, 
you can:
----------

- Expose an API endpoint (as you do now) for TTS audio generation.
- Use or adapt test_tts_api.py as a CLI tool for local or automated audio generation.
- Integrate the TTS API with your OpenAI-driven backend, so responses are synthesized to audio on demand.

For production, you may want to:
-----------------------------------

- Add error handling, logging, and configuration options to your CLI/API.
- Ensure your API can handle concurrent requests if used in a web service.

In summary:  
-----------

You can use your current test script for production, or refactor it for more features and robustness as needed. 
Your architecture is already well-suited for audio-only TTS with OpenAI and Uvicorn integration.

yes implement this approach step by step . And create a new CLI for audio separate from CLI avatar
 that i have already?

 answer:
 -----------
 Created 3 todos

We'll proceed step by step:

1. Design a new CLI for audio-only TTS (separate from your CLI avatar).
2. Implement the CLI script (e.g., cli_audio.py) to generate and play audio from text.
3. Test and document the new CLI for production/demo use.

I'll start by designing the structure for the new CLI script.

###################################################################
Start:  Design
############################################################

Starting (1/3) *Design new CLI for audio-only TTS*

Here’s the planned structure for your new CLI audio script (to be placed in backend/realestate_agent/cli_audio.py):

- Accept text input (from command line argument, file, or prompt)
- Send the text to your TTS API endpoint 
(e.g., http://localhost:8000/agent/tts)
- Save the returned audio as a .wav file
- Optionally play the audio (using aplay or another player)
- Add error handling and clear output messages

Next, I’ll implement this script in the correct location.

play what i want you to create udio cli like avatart that i prompt in the treminal and chatgpt answer 
me then tts gen text and audio and record then play.
** Check this file:
backend/realestate_agent/cli_avatar.py

To match your avatar CLI flow but for audio only, your new CLI should:

1. Prompt you for input in the terminal.
2. Send your input to ChatGPT (OpenAI API) and get the AI's response.
3. Send the AI's response to your TTS API to generate audio.
4. Save and play the audio automatically.

I'll implement a new CLI script (e.g., `cli_audio_chat.py`) in realestate_agent that follows this flow, 
using your OpenAI integration and TTS API, but skipping all video/Wav2Lip steps. 

Created [](file:///home/hazem-elbatawy/Downloads/vox-estate-agent/backend/realestate_agent/cli_audio_chat.py)

A new CLI script, cli_audio_chat.py, has been created in backend/realestate_agent/. It prompts you for input, 
gets a ChatGPT response, generates TTS audio, saves it, and plays it back—just like your avatar CLI, but 
audio-only.

If you see "could not be resolved" errors for dotenv or openai, install them with:
```sh
pip install python-dotenv openai
```

You can now run this script for a full audio chat experience in your terminal! Let me know if you want usage
 instructions or further customization.

i want to play that sound audio!!

Answer:
--------


Your CLI script is working and has generated the audio file `tts_audio_chat.wav`.  
However, the playback message ("Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono") suggests the audio format may not be compatible with your system or player.

**To play the sound:**
- Try using a different player, such as `ffplay` (from ffmpeg) or `mpv`:
  ```sh
  ffplay tts_audio_chat.wav
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  mpv tts_audio_chat.wav
  ```
- If you still hear no sound, check that your TTS API is generating audio in a standard format (e.g., 16-bit PCM, 22050 Hz or 44100 Hz).

**If you want to convert the audio to a more standard format:**
```sh
ffmpeg -i tts_audio_chat.wav -ar 22050 -ac 1 -sample_fmt s16 tts_audio_chat_fixed.wav
ffplay tts_audio_chat_fixed.wav
```

Let me know if you need help with audio format conversion or troubleshooting playback!

TTS generation failed: 'TTS' object has no attribute 'tts_batch'
INFO:     127.0.0.1:58480 - "POST /agent/tts HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

The error is clear:  
`TTS generation failed: 'TTS' object has no attribute 'tts_batch'`

**Cause:**  
The Coqui TTS API version you have installed does not support the `tts_batch` method.  
You are calling `tts.tts_batch(texts)` in your code, but your version only supports `tts_to_file` and `tts` for single sentences.

**How to fix:**  
- Replace the batch call with a loop that calls `tts.tts` for each sentence, then concatenate the results.
- Or, if you only need single-sentence TTS, use `tts.tts_to_file(text, file_path=output_path)`.

**Example fix for batching:**
```python
wavs = [tts.tts(sentence) for sentence in texts]
```
Then concatenate as before.

Would you like me to update your `generate_tts_audio` function to fix this?


Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Your `generate_tts_audio` function now loops over sentences and uses `tts.tts` for each, instead of the unsupported `tts_batch`. This should resolve the TTS generation error and allow your API to produce valid WAV audio.

Test your TTS API and CLI again. If you encounter further issues, share the error message and I'll help you debug!

 Your TTS API is now working and returning a valid WAV file (`RIFF` header, `Content-Type: audio/wav`).  
However, the error is:  
`aplay: test_wavefile:1159:  can't play WAVE-files with sample 64 bits wide`

**Cause:**  
The generated WAV file uses a sample width (bit depth) of 64 bits, which is not supported by most audio players (standard is 16 bits).

**How to fix:**  
Update your TTS code to ensure the output WAV uses 16-bit samples.  
In your tts_coqui.py, change the write line to:
```python
write(output_path, sample_rate, combined.astype(np.int16))
```
This will convert the audio to 16-bit PCM, which is compatible with most players.

Would you like me to update your code for this?


backend/realestate_agent/tts/tts_coqui.py
Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Your code now saves the WAV file as 16-bit PCM, which is compatible with standard audio players like aplay, ffplay, and mpv.

Try generating and playing audio again—this should resolve the playback error! Let me know if it works or if you need further help.

Here’s a comparison of your TTS workflows:

**1. Wav2Lip/Avatar Pipeline:**
- Uses FastAPI TTS endpoint (`/agent/tts`) to generate audio.
- The audio is saved as a WAV file and passed to Wav2Lip for video generation.
- The TTS API uses your Python backend (likely `generate_tts_audio` from tts_coqui.py).

**2. CLI Audio/Batch Script:**
- The batch script (batch_tts.sh) uses the Coqui TTS CLI directly:
  ```
  tts --text "$line" --model_name tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts --out_path "input_$n.wav"
  ```
- Your CLI audio scripts use the FastAPI TTS endpoint, which calls the same backend as the avatar pipeline.

**Key Parameters:**
- Both use the same TTS model: `tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts`.
- The batch script may use different default normalization, scaling, or output settings compared to your Python API.

**Possible Differences:**
- The Coqui TTS CLI (`tts` command) may apply normalization or scaling automatically.
- Your Python API (`generate_tts_audio`) may not normalize or scale the output, resulting in silent or quiet audio.

**Recommendation:**
- Add normalization to your Python TTS output before saving:
  ```python
  # Normalize audio to -1.0 to 1.0 range before converting to int16
  max_val = np.max(np.abs(combined))
  if max_val > 0:
      combined = combined / max_val
  write(output_path, sample_rate, (combined * 32767).astype(np.int16))
  ```
- This will ensure your audio is loud and clear, matching the CLI output.

Would you like me to update your TTS code to include normalization?
