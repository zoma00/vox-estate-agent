Perfect! üéØ

That's even better! You have a field in the application interface where you can enter the API key directly.

## ‚úÖ **For the Input Field in Your App:**

**Use the key exactly as is, without quotes:**

```
## üöÄ **Client Experience:**

1. **Open the app**: http://46.232.249.36:8501
2. **Find the OpenAI API Key field** in the interface
3. **Paste the key** (without quotes)
4. **Start using GPT features** immediately!

This is much more user-friendly for your client - they can simply paste the key into the web interface instead of dealing with terminal commands. Great design! üëç

**The app will then use this key for all AI-powered product suggestions and descriptions.**

Created env file and this is the seps following it :


```


Made changes.


```
Your CLI now automatically loads environment variables from the .env file using python-dotenv.

However, you need to install the required packages if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv openai requests
```
This will resolve the import errors for dotenv, openai, and requests. 
Let me know if you need help with anything else!
