Local TTS engine (ttspyx3 or similar) or Ollama local models — why they need more resources
Local TTS engines and model inference typically:
consume substantial RAM (models can be hundreds of MBs to many GBs),
** My freind i already use the ttspyx3 Model for generate sound wave of the openai response, so it is not option. Which it means i must use the business VPS to deal with the ttspysx3 because the basic VPS will not have sufficient RAM.

Starting (7/7) *Recommend VPS tier for ttspyx3*

Short answer — because you already run ttspyx3 locally, the 1 vCPU / 1 GB VPS will almost certainly
 fail for stable inference; the `VPS Business (2 vCPU / 2 GB)` might work for very low‑load 
 testing but is fragile; I recommend `VPS Professional (3 vCPU / 4 GB)` as the practical minimum 
 for running ttspyx3 reliably (or better: a dedicated inference worker with 8+ GB if you need 
 responsive, concurrent TTS).

Why (concise reasoning)
- Local TTS models like ttspyx3 typically require multiple hundreds of MBs to several GBs of 
RAM at runtime. 1 GB is too small. 2 GB can sometimes load a very small model but leaves no
 headroom for OS, uvicorn, or concurrency. 4 GB gives usable headroom for model memory + process
  + OS + small concurrency.
- CPU affects latency: 1–2 vCPUs are slow for inference; 3+ vCPUs noticeably reduce latency 
for CPU‑only inference. For real-time or low-latency TTS, a GPU or a larger CPU instance is 
recommended.

Recommendation
- For simple demos with very low requests (one inference at a time) and if you accept occasional OOM/latency: `VPS Business (2 vCPU / 2 GB)` might be acceptable short-term.
- For stable local ttspyx3 usage (recommended): choose `VPS Professional (3 vCPU / 4 GB)`.
- If you need comfortable concurrency or lower latency or plan to run heavier models: use a dedicated machine with 8+ GB RAM or GPU instance.

Concrete tests and checks you can run before/after provisioning
- Check model disk size (locally) to estimate memory:
```bash
# find model directory size (local machine)
du -sh path/to/ttspyx3_model_dir
```
- Start a local inference process and watch peak memory:
```bash
# run model (example command you use locally), then in another terminal:
# check memory per pid
ps aux --sort=-rss | head -n 20
# or more detailed (install smem)
sudo apt install -y smem
sudo smem -k -c \"pid user name rss command\" | sort -nrk3 | head
```
- Simulate on a small VM or container with the same RAM to see OOM/latency before buying.

If you already purchased the `VPS Business`, how to make it less risky
- Enable 2GB swap (emergency, not a replacement for RAM):
```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```
- Run ttspyx3 as a single dedicated service (systemd) and limit concurrency to 1.
- Offload everything else: host DB externally, serve static files via CDN, and do builds locally.
- Monitor memory and set alerts; upgrade quickly if the service hits swap/OOM.

Service pattern I recommend (production‑safe)
- Run your web app (`uvicorn`) on the VPS (1–2 workers).
- Run ttspyx3 as a separate systemd “inference worker” on the same host only if you have >=4 GB RAM; otherwise run the worker on a separate host with more RAM.
- Use a job queue (Redis + RQ/RabbitMQ/Dramatiq) so the web process enqueues TTS jobs and worker(s) process them; you can run workers on a larger machine later without changing frontend.

Example minimal `systemd` for an inference worker (only on 4GB+ host)
```ini
[Unit]
Description=ttspyx3 inference worker
After=network.target

[Service]
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/home/deploy/vox-estate-agent/backend
EnvironmentFile=/etc/propestateai.env
ExecStart=/home/deploy/venv/bin/python -m ttspyx3.server --port 5100
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Edge cases to consider
- Model file > available disk: ensure model fits on the VPS disk (download size + extra for extraction).
- Cold start memory spike: some runtimes spike on first request—monitor and allow warm‑up.
- Concurrency: multiple simultaneous requests quickly multiply memory needs (pooling/queue helps).
- Latency sensitivity: CPU inference on 3 vCPU may be slow; for real-time use, prefer GPU worker.

Next concrete actions I can do for you (pick one)
1. Prepare a short checklist and a `systemd` + `nginx` deployment snippet prefilled for `VPS Professional (3vCPU/4GB)`.
2. Add a worker pattern example (Redis + RQ) and sample code to enqueue TTS jobs from FastAPI so you can run workers on a larger machine later.
3. Draft a quick test script that runs a single ttspyx3 inference and reports peak RAM usage (you can run it locally or on a small VM to validate memory needs).
4. If you want to run ttspyx3 remotely, I can prepare a secure inference endpoint (systemd + nginx reverse proxy) and an example FastAPI client call.

If your priority is reliability, pick (1) or (2). If you want to validate memory first, pick (3) and I’ll produce the exact test script you can run locally and on a small VM to measure memory/CPU. Which shall I do?
