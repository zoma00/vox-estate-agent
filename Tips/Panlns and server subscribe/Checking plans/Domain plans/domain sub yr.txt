** So give me your recommendation about buy the cheapest domain , 
Avoide noise and don't provide configs for the domain or server right now.
 Just concentrate on selecting the domain name. I think i can select .space or .site

Good call narrowing to `.space` vs `.site`. Short recommendation and why:

Recommendation
- Pick `propestateai.site`.

Why `.site` (concise)
- Low‑noise and neutral — reads like a real product/site, not a gimmick.
- More professional and familiar to users than `.space` 
(which can feel novelty/portfolio-focused).
- Cheap first‑year promos are available (.site often $0.99) and it’s short/clear.
- Neutral for marketing and SEO (no penalty for `.site`), and it’s easy to type 
and remember.

When you might prefer `.space`
- Use `.space` if you want a distinct, creative brand vibe 
(e.g., portfolio, community, or novelty). It stands out but can feel less 
"businesslike".

Extra quick notes (no server/configs)
-------------------------------------------

- Check renewal price before buying — promos are cheap first year but renewals
 can be much higher.

- Enable WHOIS/privacy and auto‑renew (or set calendar reminders).
- If you care about brand protection and budget allows, register `propestateai.com` 
(if available) or one more TLD (.shop/.store/.com) later — but for a lean demo, 
`.site` is perfectly fine.

If you want, I’ll:
--------------------
- Hold on configs until you buy the domain.
- After you register, I can generate the exact DNS and nginx/certbot steps
 prefilled with your domain and VPS IP.

Shall I mark `propestateai.site` as chosen and proceed when you confirm purchase?

Short answer — domains are normally sold on a yearly basis (first‑year promos common). Monthly billing for a single domain is uncommon; registrars bundle monthly billing into hosting plans, not domain registration.

Quick notes & recommendations
- Pricing: first‑year promos (US$0.99) are fine — check the renewal price (usually much higher). Don’t be surprised by renewal cost.
- Term: buy 1 year (or multiple years if you want to lock price). You can renew annually or enable auto‑renew.
- Privacy: enable WHOIS privacy (if available) to hide your personal info.
- Auto‑renew: enable to avoid accidental expiration, or set reminders if you prefer manual renewals.
- Registrar features: prefer registrars with easy DNS management, DNSSEC, and account recovery.
- Nameservers: keep registrar DNS if you want simple control, or use Cloudflare for CDN/proxy later.
- SSL/HTTPS: use Let’s Encrypt on the server (free) after DNS points to the VPS.
- Backup: after purchase, immediately set low TTL while testing, then increase TTL to reduce DNS propagation times.

Checklist after purchase (replace YOUR_DOMAIN and VPS_IP)
````bash
# 1) Set DNS at registrar: A @ -> VPS_IP, CNAME www -> @
# 2) Verify DNS propagation
dig +short A YOUR_DOMAIN
dig +short A www.YOUR_DOMAIN

# 3) On your Ubuntu VPS (install basics if not done)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx ufw

# 4) Open firewall for web
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable

# 5) After nginx config, get TLS
sudo certbot --nginx -d YOUR_DOMAIN -d www.YOUR_DOMAIN
# test renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
````

Which TLD to pick?
- If you want the cheap promo: choose one you like (.shop or .site are good). Prefer .shop for a commercial feel, .site is neutral.

If you want, I’ll:
- Generate a prefilled nginx config + certbot steps for the exact domain and your VPS IP, or
- Walk you through purchasing and DNS setup step‑by‑step. Which do you want me to prepare next?
