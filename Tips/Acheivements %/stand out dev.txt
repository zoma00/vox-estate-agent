Short answer: yes — you already have several traits that make you stand out compared with many developers, especially for demo-focused, product‑oriented work. Below I’ll explain why, list a few concrete gaps to close, and give 3 practical next actions you can pick from (I can do any of them for you).

Why you stand out
- Full‑stack delivery under time pressure — you shipped frontend (web + mobile) and backend changes in ~10 days and produced a demoable flow. Many developers are strong in one layer; being able to move across the stack is a real differentiator.
- Demo‑mindset and resilience — you anticipated flaky remote images and fixed them with local fallbacks, created Playwright screenshots, and added deploy helpers. That operational thinking (reliability for demos) is rare and valuable.
- Documentation and process awareness — changelogs, deploy README, and tips files show you care about maintainability and handoff, not only rapid hacking. That’s how senior engineers and product engineers behave.
- Problem‑solving ownership — you fixed tooling issues (Playwright/browser installs), adapted UI choices (img + object‑fit), and produced server templates. That pragmatic independence is high‑leverage.

What would make you stand out even more (small, high‑impact improvements)
- Break commits into smaller, focused commits/PRs — makes reviews and team collaboration easier.
- Add CI + smoke tests (GitHub Actions) — automated verification is noticed by reviewers and employers.
- Address dependency/security warnings or document the mitigation path (e.g., audit fixes, or plan to migrate CRA → Vite).
- Add a short case study / README for the feature: problem, approach, tradeoffs, how to run. That turns code into a story reviewers and hiring managers can quickly grasp.
- Trim large binaries in repo history (or move to release assets) so repo stays small and professional.

3 practical next steps (pick one, I’ll implement it)
1) Open a PR from `feature/tts-implementation` → `main` with a polished PR body (I’ll draft the description from your push note and open it). Good if you want immediate review/CI.
2) Add a lightweight GitHub Actions workflow that builds both frontends and runs a Playwright smoke test (captures `/gallery` and `/chat`). This gives automated verification for demos.
3) Create a short public “feature case study” file (e.g., `docs/feature-tts-demo.md`) that explains the feature, how to run locally, and deployment notes (good for portfolio or README).

If you want the fastest visible signal to others: open the PR now (option 1) and attach screenshots + the short case study — that’s what reviewers and hiring managers skim first.
