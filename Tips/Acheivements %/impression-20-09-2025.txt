Impression: Full‑Stack Developer (summary)
Date: 2025-09-20

Short summary
-------------
Based on the work I reviewed in this repo and our interactions, here’s a concise impression:

- Technical competence: You move comfortably across frontend and backend stacks. You edit React components, CSS, asset paths, and backend integrations. You handle both Vite and CRA projects and make targeted UI improvements.
- Troubleshooting & persistence: You don’t stop at the first failure. You debug port/HMR issues, Playwright/browser binary problems, and asset loading edge cases. That persistence is a strong technical trait.
- Product focus: You care about parity between platforms, demo readiness, and user-facing polish (hero, gallery layout, readable copy). You also document changes and produce verification artifacts.
- Collaboration readiness: You work in small, reviewable edits and leave changelogs — good habits for team work and code reviews.

Where you already shine
-----------------------
- End-to-end feature work: component, styles, routing, and asset handling.
- Good instincts for fallbacks and progressive enhancement (image fallbacks, TTS flow considerations).
- Comfortable with developer tooling: starting servers, running audits, and using headless tests.

High‑impact focus areas (next steps)
------------------------------------
1. Tests & automation: Add component/unit tests (React Testing Library) and an E2E smoke test (Playwright) to catch regressions early.
2. CI/CD + quality gates: Add GitHub Actions to run lint/test/build for both frontends on PRs.
3. Dependency hygiene: Address transitive `npm audit` issues; plan CRA→Vite migration in a branch if needed.
4. UX/perf: Use lazy-loading, blur-up placeholders, and serve images via a CDN in production.
5. Backend contracts: Add small contract tests and graceful error handling on the frontends.

Concrete 30‑day path (weekly milestones)
----------------------------------------
Week 1: Add 3–4 component tests (Gallery mobile + web), and one Playwright screenshot test. Add lint step.
Week 2: Add GitHub Actions workflow (CI) to run tests and builds on PRs. Fix any failures.
Week 3: Implement image lazy-loading + fallback blur placeholders and prefer `coverPhoto.url` with local fallback.
Week 4: Prepare deployable build (Vercel/Netlify or Docker) and do a demo deployment.

Likelihood of success
---------------------
You have the technical skills, product focus, and persistence required to ship a product and grow as a full‑stack developer. If you adopt automated tests, CI, and consistent releases you dramatically increase your chance of long‑term success.

How I can help next
-------------------
Pick one and I’ll implement it for you:
- Add React Testing Library tests for `Gallery` (web + mobile) and run them.
- Create a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs tests and builds both frontends.
- Change gallery thumbnails to prefer `property.coverPhoto.url` and fall back to local assets; add lazy-loading.
- Scaffold CRA → Vite migration for the web frontend in a separate branch.
