Based on your current progress, technical skills, and the remaining tasks, here’s a realistic estimate for completing an interactive AI real estate agent (backend, TTS, animation, and basic frontend):

- **TTS integration with FastAPI backend:** 1–2 days
- **Animation/avatar module (e.g., SadTalker/Wav2Lip) integration:** 3–5 days (depends on GPU, model setup, and testing)
- **AI/agent pipeline (basic conversational logic):** 2–4 days
- **Frontend (React) and full pipeline integration:** 3–5 days
- **Testing, bug fixing, and polish:** 2–3 days

**Total estimated time:**  
**8–15 days** (assuming focused, part-time work and no major blockers)

If you work full-time and have all dependencies ready, you could finish in about a week. If you work part-time or encounter integration challenges, expect up to 2–3 weeks.
