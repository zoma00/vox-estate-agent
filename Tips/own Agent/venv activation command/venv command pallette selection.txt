You are correct! Since your terminal shows:
```
(venv) ...$ python --version
Python 3.11.13
```
This means your virtual environment (venv) with Python 3.11.13 is active.

In the VS Code command palette, you should select the interpreter that matches your venv, which will look like:
```
python 3.11.13/bin/python3
```
or
```
/home/hazem-elbatawy/Downloads/vox-estate-agent/backend/realestate_agent/venv/bin/python
```
This ensures you are using the same environment in both the terminal and VS Code. Your setup is correct!


This happens when VS Code is not detecting your virtual environment (venv) automatically. Here’s how to fix it:

1. **Make sure you have activated your venv in the terminal:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **In VS Code:**
   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
   - Type and select: `Python: Select Interpreter`
   - Choose the interpreter that points to your project’s `venv` (it should look like `.venv/bin/python` or `venv/bin/python`).

3. **Restart VS Code** after selecting the correct interpreter.

4. **Check the bottom left of VS Code:**  
   You should see the name of your venv (e.g., `venv`) in the status bar.

Now, VS Code will use your virtual environment and recognize all installed packages. Let me know if you need step-by-step screenshots or further help!
