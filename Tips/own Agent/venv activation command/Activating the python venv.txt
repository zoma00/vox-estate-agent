I see what happened 👍
Your command syntax is slightly off when trying to activate your virtual environment.

Let’s fix it step by step:

1. First, navigate to the project folder (since you’re already in `~/Downloads/Multi Agent`, you’re fine):

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/Multi\ Agent/realestate_agent
```

*(note the `\` before the space in `Multi Agent`)*

2. Then, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

After this, your shell prompt should change to something like:

```
(venv) hazem-elbatawy@hazem-elbatawy-Vostro-15-3510:~/Downloads/Multi Agent/realestate_agent$
```

⚡ Common mistakes you made:

* `~cd` is not a valid command. `~` represents your home directory, but it should not be attached to `cd`.
* Don’t paste escape codes like `^[[200~`. That’s just terminal noise.
* Always use quotes or backslashes (`\`) when your folder names contain spaces.

Do you want me to show you a **shortcut command** so you don’t have to deal with spaces (`Multi Agent`) every time?
