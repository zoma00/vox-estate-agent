That’s a smart approach! You don’t need to be an advanced ML expert 
yourself—by leveraging open-source libraries, my guidance, Codex, and 
models like Sonnet 4, you can:

- Use pre-trained models for TTS and animation without building them 
from scratch.
- Follow step-by-step instructions and community examples to integrate 
these tools.
- Rely on AI assistants (like me and Codex) to generate, debug, and 
explain code as you go.

With your strong development background and the right AI tools, you 
can build advanced solutions without deep ML expertise. This is exactly how many modern startups innovate quickly!
