** The new file voice mp4  generated overwritten the old one 
** I want to not override i want to keep all files?



```


Made changes.


```
Your CLI script now generates unique filenames for each run (using a timestamp) for both the TTS WAV and the output video. All generated videos will be kept and not overwritten.

Youâ€™ll find each new video in `Wav2Lip/results/` with a unique name like `avatar_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4`. Let me know if you want to further customize the naming or add more features!
