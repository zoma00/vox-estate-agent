Great! Now that your TTS batch synthesis is working, you’re ready to integrate TTS into your FastAPI backend.

Here’s the plan for the next steps:

1. Add a FastAPI endpoint that receives text (via POST or GET).
2. Call your TTS function (using Coqui TTS) to generate audio from the received text.
3. Return the generated audio file as a response (e.g., as a downloadable .wav or as a stream).

Would you like me to scaffold the FastAPI endpoint and show

Your FastAPI backend is now set up to generate TTS audio and return it as a downloadable .wav file using best practices:

- The `/agent/tts` endpoint receives text, calls your real TTS function, and streams the audio file as a response.
- The TTS logic is modular and error-handled in agent_pipeline.py.

You can now POST text to `/agent/tts` and receive the generated audio directly.

Let me know if you want a sample client request, further improvements, or to proceed with more integration!

def generate_ai_response(user_text: str) -> str:
    # TODO: Integrate with OpenAI or other LLM
    return f"AI response to: {user_text}"

# Placeholder for TTS audio generation
def generate_tts_audio(text: str, voice: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    # Use the real Coqui TTS implementation
    output_path = "tts_output.wav"
    try:
        return coqui_generate_tts_audio(text, output_path=output_path)
    except Exception as e:
        # Log or handle error as needed
        print(f"TTS generation failed: {e}")
        return ""

** I want to test type a text and get response.


To test your FastAPI TTS endpoint, you can use curl, httpie, or a tool like Postman. Here’s a simple example using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agent/tts" -F "text=Hello, this is a test from FastAPI!" --output tts_output.wav
```

- This sends a POST request with your text.
- The response (audio) will be saved as tts_output.wav.

Or, if you want a Python example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/agent/tts",
    data={"text": "Hello, this is a test from FastAPI!"}
)
with open("tts_output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

Let me know if you want a different example or run into any issues!

i want to run the python example and create test script for it.


Made changes.

A test script named test_tts_api.py has been created.  
To use it:

1. Make sure your FastAPI server is running.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python test_tts_api.py
   ```
3. The audio will be saved as tts_output.wav if the request is successful.

If you see an error about the requests library, install it with:
```bash
pip install requests
```

Let me know if you need help running the script or want to customize the test!

Your FastAPI server is running, but the test script is sending the text as form data, while your FastAPI endpoint expects it as a query parameter.

**How to fix:**

1. Update your FastAPI endpoint to accept form data (best for POST requests):

In main.py, change:
```python
@app.post("/agent/tts")
def agent_tts(text: str):
```
to:
```python
from fastapi import Form

@app.post("/agent/tts")
def agent_tts(text: str = Form(...)):
```

2. Now your test script will work as expected with form data.

Your FastAPI endpoint is now correct, but your test script is still sending the data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded (by default with data=...), not as multipart/form-data (which Form expects).

**How to fix:**  
Update your test script to use the files parameter instead of data:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/agent/tts"
text = "Hello, this is a test from FastAPI!"

response = requests.post(url, files={"text": (None, text)})

if response.status_code == 200:
    with open("tts_output.wav", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    print("Audio saved to tts_output.wav")
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

This will send the text as multipart/form-data, matching what FastAPI expects for Form fields.

Let me know if this resolves the issue!

Analysis:
---------
Success! Your FastAPI TTS endpoint and test script are now working perfectly—audio is generated and saved as tts_output.wav.

You can now build on this foundation, add more features, or integrate with your frontend.  
Let me know if you want to proceed with more endpoints, add authentication, or need any other improvements!
