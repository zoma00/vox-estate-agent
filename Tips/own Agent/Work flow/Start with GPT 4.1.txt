You can start this project with my helpâ€”I can guide you step-by-step, 
generate code, and help you debug and architect your solution. Codex (the OpenAI coding agent) is also helpful, especially for generating and editing larger code blocks or
 automating multi-step tasks, but you do not need Codex 
 to begin.

If you want a conversational, interactive coding assistant,
 use me (GitHub Copilot). If you want a dedicated coding
  panel and cloud delegation, Codex is a good addition.
   Both can support your project, but you can achieve your 
   goals with my assistance alone.
