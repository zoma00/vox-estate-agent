If you use Docker, a VPS (not AWS/Azure), pgAdmin/PostgreSQL for your database, and a domain, here’s a realistic breakdown
 for a small/medium project:
================================

1- VPS (with enough CPU/RAM for TTS and animation, but no GPU): $20–$40/month 
(providers: Hetzner, Contabo, DigitalOcean, OVH, etc.)

2- Domain name: $10–$15/year (about $1/month)

3- Storage: Usually included in VPS, unless you need a lot of video storage (add $5–$10/month if needed)

4- PostgreSQL/pgAdmin: Free (open source)

5- Docker: Free (open source)

6- Bandwidth: Usually included in VPS plan, unless you have very high traffic

**Total realistic monthly cost:**  
--------------------------------------

$21–$50/month for most small/medium deployments (VPS + domain + some storage).

If you need a GPU for faster or higher-quality video generation, VPS with GPU starts at $60–$120/month,
 but for basic TTS and CPU-based animation, you can start at the lower end.

This does not include your own time for setup and maintenance.


The “lower end” specifically means:
------------------------------------

- VPS: $20/month (e.g., Hetzner CX22, Contabo VPS S, DigitalOcean 2vCPU/4GB RAM)
- Domain: $1/month (about $12/year)
- Storage: Included in most VPS plans for moderate usage
- Bandwidth: Included in most VPS plans for moderate usage

So, your total monthly cost can realistically be as low as **$21–$25/month**

 for a small/medium project if you don’t need a GPU and your storage/bandwidth 
 needs are typical.

** That is grate conclution.

So how i will reach this level in
 my production. And what will be the real
  cost for me to deploy this on a a server 
  if i used docker then deploy on a domain.


  To reach D-ID’s level in your own production:
-------------------------------------------------

1. You need to combine open-source tools for TTS (text-to-speech), facial animation (e.g., SadTalker, Wav2Lip),
 and a backend (FastAPI/Flask) to automate video generation.

2. Containerize your app with Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

3. Deploy on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Azure) and connect your domain.

Real cost factors:
-------------------

- Cloud server: $20–$100/month for a basic GPU or high-CPU instance (cost increases with traffic and video generation demand).
- Storage: Small extra cost for storing generated videos.
- Bandwidth: Depends on user volume and video size.
- Maintenance: Your time for updates, bug fixes, and scaling.

For a small/medium project, expect $30–$150/month for infrastructure.
 If you need real-time or high-quality video at scale, costs will rise 
 (GPU servers are more expensive). Your main savings come from not paying per-video
  or per-minute fees, 
 but you must manage and maintain the system yourself.
