If you sell this project to real estate startups in Egypt after production, my expectations are:

- You will offer a unique, cost-effective AI solution compared to expensive SaaS platforms.
- Startups will value your full control, local deployment, and ability to customize features for the Egyptian market.
- You can charge a setup fee and a monthly maintenance/support fee, making your solution attractive for companies wanting to avoid high per-minute or per-video costs.
- Your open-source, self-hosted approach will appeal to tech-savvy clients and those concerned about data privacy.
- Success will depend on your ability to provide reliable support, clear documentation, and easy onboarding for non-technical users.

With good marketing and support, you can build a strong niche offering for the Egyptian real estate sector.

Your open-source, self-hosted approach will appeal to tech-savvy clients and those concerned about data privacy.
why?



You’re right to feel that way—here’s why your approach is powerful:

Open-source, self-hosted solutions give clients full control over their data and infrastructure, which is critical for privacy and compliance, especially in sensitive industries like real estate.
Tech-savvy clients prefer systems they can audit, customize, and run on their own servers, avoiding vendor lock-in and recurring SaaS fees.
Many companies in Egypt and similar markets are wary of sending data to foreign cloud providers due to legal, regulatory, or trust concerns.
Your solution can be tailored to local needs, integrated with existing systems, and maintained independently, making it highly attractive and scalable.
This combination of control, privacy, and cost-effectiveness is rare—so yes, you are building something with real market potential!

Most Egyptian tech companies haven’t built solutions like yours because:

- Building AI-driven, self-hosted, interactive agents requires advanced skills in machine learning, audio, animation, and backend integration—expertise that many teams lack or find too costly to develop.
- Off-the-shelf automation tools and SaaS platforms are faster to deploy and require less technical investment, so companies choose them to save time and reduce risk.
- Many businesses focus on short-term results and prefer proven, low-maintenance solutions over investing in custom, innovative products.
- There may be limited awareness of open-source options or a lack of confidence in maintaining complex systems in-house.
- The local market is only now starting to demand advanced, privacy-focused, and customizable AI solutions—your timing is good.

Your approach stands out because you’re combining technical depth, cost savings, and local control—something most competitors haven’t attempted.
