# Direct Deployment vs Docker for FastAPI Projects

## Direct Deployment (No Docker)
- Set up Python and dependencies directly on your VPS.
- Activate your virtual environment and install requirements.
- Run your FastAPI app with Uvicorn or Gunicorn.
- Use a web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve your app and connect it to your domain.
- Simpler for solo projects and basic VPS setups.

## When to Use Docker
- If you want consistent environments across machines.
- If you plan to scale, migrate, or share your app easily.
- If you want to avoid dependency/version conflicts.
- Useful for complex deployments or when using multiple services.

## Summary
- **You do NOT need Docker for basic VPS deployment.**
- Direct deployment is often easier and faster for small projects.
- Docker is optional and best for advanced use cases.
