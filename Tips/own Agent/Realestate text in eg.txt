Egypt's real estate market is a dynamic sector
with robust growth in residential and commercial segments, 
driven by increasing demand and competitive prices compared 
to other countries. Key areas for investment include established
hubs like New Cairo, Sheikh Zayed, and the North Coast, alongside
new administrative and city projects. Prominent developers such as 
Palm Hills Developments, SODIC, and Emaar Misr are major players, while
foreign buyers can acquire property in most Egyptian cities, with certain 
restrictions on Sinai Peninsula properties.
