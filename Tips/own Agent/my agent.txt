Your idea to build your own agent is smart for long-term cost savings and full control.
 Hereâ€™s my suggestion for your project:

1. Start with a modular architecture:
   - Separate the chatbot logic (OpenAI API or similar) from the avatar/animation layer.
   - Use Python (FastAPI or Flask) for backend logic and API endpoints.

2. For interactive avatars:
   - Begin with open-source facial animation tools like SadTalker or Wav2Lip for talking 
   head videos.
   - Use open-source TTS (e.g., Coqui TTS, VITS, or Google TTS API) for realistic voices.
   - For real-time animation, explore Three.js (JavaScript) or Unity (C#) for web-based 3D
    avatars.

3. Use Codex or Copilot to help you generate, refactor, and debug code as you build.

4. For your campaign:
   - Create a few unique AI agent personas with different looks and bios.
   - Use your avatar pipeline to generate short, fun intro videos for each agent.
   - Build a simple web app where users can interact with the agents (ask questions,
    get property matches, etc.).
   - Collect feedback and iterate.

5. Document your process and keep your code modular so you can upgrade components 
(better TTS, more realistic animation) as open-source tools improve.

This approach gives you full ownership, no recurring avatar/video costs, 
and the flexibility to innovate. If you want, I can help you plan the tech stack,
 suggest open-source libraries, or provide sample code to get started!
