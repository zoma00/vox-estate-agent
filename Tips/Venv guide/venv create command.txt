In Python, you can use the **`venv`** module to create a virtual environment (isolated Python environment).

The basic command is:

```bash
python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
```

### Example:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a folder named `venv` in your current directory, containing a standalone Python environment.

### Activating the virtual environment

* **On Linux/MacOS (bash/zsh):**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

* **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* **On Windows (PowerShell):**

  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

### Deactivating

To leave the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

⚡Tip: Always create a virtual environment for each project to avoid dependency conflicts.

Do you want me to also show you how to check if `venv` is installed and troubleshoot if the command doesn’t work?
