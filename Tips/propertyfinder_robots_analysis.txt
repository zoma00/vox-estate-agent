## What This Means
1. **No Scraping**: The site explicitly blocks web scraping tools and automated access to property listings.
2. **No API Access**: The `/ajax/` directory (likely containing API endpoints) is restricted.
3. **Legal Implications**: Attempting to bypass these restrictions may violate their Terms of Service.

## Recommended Alternatives
1. **Official Access**:
   - Contact Property Finder for official API access
   - Inquire about partnership opportunities

2. **Alternative APIs**:
   - Bayut API (covers Middle East, including Egypt)
   - Aqarmap (if they offer an API)
   - Other real estate data providers with proper licensing

3. **Legal Considerations**:
   - Always respect robots.txt and website terms of service
   - Consider using official APIs or data providers
   - For research purposes, check if they offer data exports or research partnerships
