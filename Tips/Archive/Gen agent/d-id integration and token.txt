To integrate your D-ID agent with your Python application (using FastAPI), you need to use the D-ID API, not just the share link. The share link is for viewing the agent in a browser, but API integration allows you to programmatically generate videos or interact with the agent from your app.

Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

1. Get D-ID API Access:
- Sign up at https://www.d-id.com/ and get API credentials (API key/secret).

2. Review D-ID API Docs:
- See: https://docs.d-id.com/reference/overview
- The API allows you to send text and an avatar image (or agent ID) and receive a video or stream URL in response.

3. Integrate with FastAPI:
- In your FastAPI app, create an endpoint that takes user input, sends it to the D-ID API, and returns the video URL or stream.

Example FastAPI integration (simplified):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import requests

app = FastAPI()

DID_API_KEY = "YOUR_DID_API_KEY"
AGENT_ID = "v2_agt_NY84CG6e"  # Your agent ID

@app.post("/talk")
async def talk(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    user_text = data["text"]

    # D-ID API endpoint for talking agent
    url = f"https://api.d-id.com/agents/{AGENT_ID}/talks"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {DID_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "script": {
            "type": "text",
            "input": user_text,
            "provider": {"type": "microsoft", "voice_id": "en-US-JennyNeural"}
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()  # Contains video/stream URL

# You can now POST {"text": "Your message"} to /talk and get a video response
```

Replace `YOUR_DID_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

4. Use the returned video/stream URL in your frontend or app.
