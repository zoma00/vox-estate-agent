- Generating realistic talking avatar videos requires powerful servers, advanced AI models, and significant computational resources.
- They provide high-quality animation, voice synthesis, and hosting, all of which have ongoing infrastructure and development costs.
- Pricing also covers support, API reliability, commercial licensing, and scalability for business use.
- By charging more for production, they can offer lower-cost plans for demos and personal use, while ensuring sustainability and quality for high-traffic, commercial deployments.

Building and maintaining this technology at scale is expensive, so production pricing reflects those real costs.
