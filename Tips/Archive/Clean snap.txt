Nice 🚀 — now you’ve got **6.2 GB free** (95% usage). That’s better than before (you were stuck at 4.8 GB).

Here’s a quick recap:

* `/dev/sda4` (your root partition) → **117 GB total, 105 GB used, 6.2 GB free**
* `/boot/efi` → **871 MB total, 803 MB free**
* tmpfs (RAM-based filesystems) → not relevant for storage

✅ Next steps if you still want **more free space**:

1. **Clean Snap packages** (your `/var/lib/snapd` was \~9.6 GB):

   ```bash
   sudo du -sh /var/lib/snapd
   sudo snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $2}' | while read snapname revision; do sudo snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"; done
   ```

   That removes old disabled revisions.

2. **Prune Docker** with the cleanup script we prepared (to target unused stuff but keep `wav2lip` and your 2 containers).

3. **Clean apt cache**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get clean
   sudo apt-get autoremove -y
   ```

4. **Check big hidden caches** (you already saw `.cache` and `.vscode` are heavy). If you don’t need old extensions/models, you can remove them safely:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/*
   ```

👉 Do you want me to modify the cleanup script so it also includes **Snap cleanup** and **apt cache cleanup**, making it a full “system + Docker” space recovery tool?
