Yes, **763 seconds (about 12-13 minutes) is completely normal** for building a Wav2Lip Docker image, especially for the first time!

## Why it takes so long:

**Heavy Dependencies (740 seconds on pip install):**
- **PyTorch/Torchvision**: Large deep learning framework with GPU support
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library with extensive binary components  
- **Librosa**: Audio processing library with many dependencies
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Scientific computing libraries that may need compilation

## Breakdown of your build:
```
Total time: 763.6s (12.7 minutes)
├── Pip install: 740.3s (12.3 minutes) ← Most of the time
├── Image export: 16.8s
├── Copy files: 1.9s  
└── Other steps: ~5s (mostly cached)
```

## This is normal because:

**First-time builds:**
- No cached layers for pip packages
- Downloads hundreds of MB of dependencies
- Some packages compile from source
- Network speed affects download time

**Heavy ML packages:**
- PyTorch alone can be 500MB+
- OpenCV with contrib modules is large
- Audio/video processing libraries have many binary dependencies

## To speed up future builds:

**Use Docker layer caching:**
```dockerfile
# Copy requirements first (separate layer)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy code later (changes more frequently)
COPY . .
```

**Use multi-stage builds or pre-built base images**

Your build completed successfully, so the time is just a one-time cost. Subsequent builds with code changes will be much faster since the pip install layer will be cached!
