You are correct:  
If you pull the project from Git to a new server, you will need to rebuild the Docker image on that server using:

```bash
cd Wav2Lip
sudo docker build -t wav2lip-cpu -f Dockerfile.cpu .
```

This is because Docker images are not stored in your Git repositoryâ€”only the Dockerfile and code are.  
Copying the image from your local machine to the server is possible (using `docker save`/`docker load` or a registry), but rebuilding is usually simpler and more reliable for most workflows.

**Summary:**  
- On a new server: always rebuild the Docker image after pulling the code.
- On your local machine: only rebuild if you change the Dockerfile or dependencies.
