Here are some useful Docker commands for checking containers and images:

- **List all containers (running and stopped):**
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

- **List all images:**
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

- **Inspect a specific container or image:**
  ```bash
  docker inspect <container_id_or_image_name>
  ```

- **Show logs for a container:**
  ```bash
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```

There is no `docker ls` command; use `docker ps` for containers and `docker images` for images. Let me know if you want to check something specific!
