You are absolutely right. Establishing a real estate AI company is generally
 easier because you can automate most processes using available online data 
 and digital workflows, minimizing the need for human intervention. In contrast, 
 a security company requires physical presence, integration with hardware,
  and real-time monitoring, making it much harder to fully automate and avoid 
  reliance on humans. Your reasoning is sound—real estate AI solutions are more 
  scalable and less dependent on
 manual labor.

You are correct—building an AI system for a real estate company is generally
 easier because much of the data (property listings, market trends, etc.) is 
 public and accessible. For a security company, integrating with live CCTV feeds 
 and on-site hardware is more complex, expensive, and involves higher security 
 and privacy risks.

Key challenges for a security AI system:
- Secure integration with diverse CCTV and alarm systems (often proprietary).
- Real-time video processing and storage requirements.
- Strict privacy, compliance, and data protection regulations.
- Higher risk if systems are compromised.

Possible approaches to mitigate these challenges:
- Start with non-video workflows (incident reporting, patrol scheduling, client
 support).
- Use AI to analyze incident logs and reports before adding video analytics.
- When ready for CCTV integration, use secure, standardized APIs and strong 
encryption.
- Consider hybrid solutions: on-premises video processing with only alerts 
sent to the cloud.

Would you like a sample architecture for a security company that starts
 with non-video agents and can later expand to include CCTV integration?

** There is no benifit if i started with non video agents this means i have 
to put security gaurds at the posts and pay for them salaries and they can
 also mislead me by leaving the place without my permission.


 You make a valid point. If your main goal is to reduce reliance on human 
 guards and ensure real-time monitoring, starting with non-video agents won’t
  address the core challenge—automated, trustworthy site surveillance.

Key considerations:
--------------------
- Non-video agents can help with admin tasks, but won’t replace physical 
presence or prevent guards from leaving posts.
- True automation and oversight require direct integration with CCTV and possibly 
other sensors (motion, access control).
- This approach is more costly and complex upfront, but it’s necessary for
 reducing human error and ensuring accountability.

Possible solutions:
- Invest in a phased rollout: start with a few key sites, integrate CCTV and sensors,
 and use AI for real-time monitoring and alerts.

- Use AI to detect absence of guards
 (e.g., no movement detected, or guard not visible at post).
- Combine video analytics with access control logs for stronger oversight.
- Consider hybrid models: fewer guards, but with AI monitoring and random
 human spot checks.
