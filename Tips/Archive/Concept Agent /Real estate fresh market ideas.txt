Great! Here’s a simple, creative digital campaign idea for your
 real estate startup using AI agents:

“Meet the AI Dream Team” Mocking Campaign:
----------------------------------------------
- Create playful social media posts introducing your AI agents as quirky digital
 employees (e.g., “Sally the Superfast Listing Agent,” “Omar the 24/7 Negotiator”).
- Use AI-generated avatars or cartoons for each agent, with fun bios and 
“interviews.”
- Share short, humorous videos or chat screenshots showing how your AI agents 
help clients (e.g., instant property matches, answering questions at 3am).
- Run a poll: “Which AI agent would you trust to find your dream home?” and 
encourage followers to vote and comment.
- End with a call-to-action: “Try our AI-powered real estate team—no humans,
 no hassle!”

This approach is light, engaging, and highlights your tech advantage. Let me
