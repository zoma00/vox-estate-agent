I'll help you stage, commit, and push your changes to the remote repository. Here's how we'll proceed:

1. First, let's check the current status to see what will be committed:


Let's start by adding all the modified and new files to the staging area:


Now, let's create a commit with a clear message that describes the changes:


Let's push the committed changes to the remote repository:


Great! Your changes have been successfully committed and pushed to the remote repository. Here's a quick summary of what was done:

1. **Staged all changes** using `git add .`
2. **Committed the changes** with a descriptive message
3. **Pushed to the main branch** of your remote repository

The commit includes:
- API token management system
- Payment integration with Stripe
- New UI components for token management
- Error handling and security measures
- Various frontend updates and new files

Your changes are now safely stored in the remote repository at `github.com:zoma00/vox-estate-agent.git` on the `main` branch.
