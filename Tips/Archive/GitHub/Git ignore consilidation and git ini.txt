 understand the issue now. Let's fix the Git repository structure and 
.gitignore
 files properly. Here's what we need to do:

Current State:
The Git repository is initialized in /backend/realestate_agent/
You have multiple 
.gitignore
 files in different locations
The frontend is not under version control yet
Recommended Structure:
vox-estate-agent/     (root Git repository)
├── .git/
├── .gitignore        (single source of truth)
├── backend/          (backend code)
└── web-frontend/     (frontend code)
Steps to Fix: a. First, let's move the Git repository to the root:
bash
# From the current directory
cd /home/hazem-elbatawy/Downloads/vox-estate-agent

# Remove the nested .git directory
rm -rf backend/realestate_agent/.git

# Initialize new git repository in the root
git init
b. The comprehensive 
.gitignore
 we created earlier is already in the root. Let's verify it:
bash
ls -la /home/hazem-elbatawy/Downloads/vox-estate-agent/.gitignore
c. Add all files and make initial commit:
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with proper repository structure"
d. Add the remote (if you had one before):
bash
git remote add origin <your-remote-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
For the frontend:
The frontend directory will now be tracked as part of the root repository
No need for a separate Git repository for the frontend
The root 
.gitignore
 already includes patterns for both frontend and backend
Cleanup (after backing up if needed):
bash
# Remove redundant .gitignore files
rm backend/.gitignore
Would you like me to help you execute any of these steps? Also, do you have an existing remote repository you'd like to connect to?

Let's proceed with setting up your Git repository. Here's what we'll do next:

First, let's rename the default branch to 'main' (a common practice):
bash
git branch -m master main
Let's check the current status to see what files will be tracked:
bash
git status
Add all the files to the staging area:
bash
git add .
Make the initial commit:
bash
git commit -m "Initial commit with proper repository structure"
If you have an existing remote repository, you can add it with:
bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main
Let's also remove the redundant 
.gitignore
 file in the backend directory:
bash
rm backend/.gitignore
Would you like me to help you execute any of these commands? Also, do you have an existing remote repository URL that you'd like to connect to?

 see you want to add your remote repository. Let's handle the nested Git repository issue first, then add the remote.

Let's remove the nested Git repository from the staging area:
bash
git rm --cached web-frontend/webfront
Now, let's add everything except the nested .git directory:
bash
find . -name .git -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
git add .
Let's make the initial commit:
bash
git commit -m "Initial commit with proper repository structure"
Now, let's add your remote repository:
bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:zoma00/vox-estate-agent.git
Finally, push your code to the remote repository:
bash
git push -u origin main
Would you like me to help you execute these commands? Also, make sure you have:

Set up your SSH key with GitHub
Have the necessary permissions to push to the repository

Let's keep the nested repository for Wave2Lip and set it up as a Git submodule. Here's how we'll do it:

First, let's remove the nested .git directory to convert it to a submodule:
bash
rm -rf web-frontend/webfront/.git
Now, let's add all files to the main repository:
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Wave2Lip as part of the main repository"
Add your remote repository:
bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:zoma00/vox-estate-agent.git
git push -u origin main
This way, the Wave2Lip code will be included directly in your repository. If you'd prefer to keep it as a separate repository that can be updated independently, we can set it up as a submodule instead. Which approach would you prefer?
