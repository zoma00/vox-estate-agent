You have **modified, deleted, and untracked files**. Letâ€™s go step by step:

### 1. Add modified + deleted files

```bash
git add -u
```

(`-u` stages modifications and deletions only)

### 2. Add new (untracked) files/folders

```bash
git add .
```

(`.` adds everything untracked in the working directory)

### 3. Commit with a message

Choose a clear message, for example:

```bash
git commit -m "Update TTS implementation: cleanup, new tools, and docs"
```

### 4. Push to your branch

```bash
git push origin feature/tts-implementation
```

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to make a **single commit with all files**, or do you prefer to **separate docs, code, and assets into multiple commits** for cleaner history?
