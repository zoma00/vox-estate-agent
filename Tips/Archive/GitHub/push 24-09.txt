You have **modified, deleted, and untracked files**. Let‚Äôs go step by step:

### 1. Add modified + deleted files

```bash
git add -u
```

(`-u` stages modifications and deletions only)

### 2. Add new (untracked) files/folders

```bash
git add .
```

(`.` adds everything untracked in the working directory)

### 3. Commit with a message

Choose a clear message, for example:

```bash
git commit -m "Update TTS implementation: cleanup, new tools, and docs"
```

### 4. Push to your branch

```bash
git push origin feature/tts-implementation
```

üëâ Do you want me to make a **single commit with all files**, or do you prefer to **separate docs, code, and assets into multiple commits** for cleaner history?

** i want to dlete these 2 files from pushed git



Understood üëç You accidentally staged and pushed those two files, and now you want to **remove them from the remote repo**.

Here‚Äôs how to do it:

### 1. Remove the files from git tracking (not just locally)

```bash
git rm --cached "Server/Connect using the xterm js.txt"
git rm --cached "Server/Connect.txt"
```

(`--cached` removes them from Git but keeps them locally on your disk)

### 2. Commit the removal

```bash
git commit -m "Remove unwanted Server/Connect files"
```

### 3. Push the change

```bash
git push origin feature/tts-implementation
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This will **delete the files from the branch in GitHub** but keep them locally.

Do you want these files **completely ignored in the future** (so they never get staged again), in which case I‚Äôll also give you the `.gitignore` update?
