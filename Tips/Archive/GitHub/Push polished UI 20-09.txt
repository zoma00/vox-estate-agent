Push summary â€” Polished UI & Deploy helpers
Date: 2025-09-20
Branch: feature/tts-implementation
Remote: origin (git@github.com:zoma00/vox-estate-agent.git)

What I pushed
- UI: Gallery improvements on mobile and web (card layout, thumbnail <img> with object-fit, price overlays, responsive grid).
- Readability tweaks for hero/demo text and mobile `.muted` styling.
- Mobile pages scaffold improvements for Chat, TTS, and Home.
- Local image fallbacks (AVIF + JPG) added to reduce broken-image risk during demos.
- Deploy helper artifacts: `scripts/deploy.sh`, `deploy/nginx-systemd/*` templates, and `deploy/README_DEPLOY.md`.
- Playwright screenshot tooling and images: `tools/screenshot.js`, `web_home.png`, `mobile_home.png`.
- Various docs and tips files under `Tips/` and `CHANGES/`.

Commit message used

Notes / Next steps
- Open a PR to `main` from `feature/tts-implementation` for review and CI testing.
- Optionally add a Playwright smoke test and a GitHub Actions workflow to run builds and tests on PRs.
- After merging, follow `deploy/README_DEPLOY.md` to deploy to your server (create venv, pip install -r requirements.txt, place systemd service and nginx config, enable/ start services, reload nginx).
