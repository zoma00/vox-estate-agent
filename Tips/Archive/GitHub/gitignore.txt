ok all the project file were add whick is about 1038 and that is not professional. I want to
** Create ingore file for this project and exclude the senstive, package , side package , pychache, .env


Made changes.

A professional .gitignore file has been created for your project. It excludes virtual environments, __pycache__, .env files, sensitive keys, generated audio/video, and more.

Next, run:
```bash
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
```
This will re-stage only the files not ignored, making your repo clean and professional. Let me know if you want these commands run or need further help!

Your `.gitignore` is well-structured and covers most common cases for Python, virtual environments, sensitive files, and generated media. Here are a few suggestions to make it even more robust for your project:

**Suggestions:**
- Add model weights and large binary files (e.g., `*.pth`, `*.pt`, `*.ckpt`) to avoid accidentally committing them.
- Ignore cache and temp folders specific to your AI pipeline (e.g., `results/`, `temp/`, `checkpoints/` in Wav2Lip).
- If you want to keep some generated results, use a pattern like `results/*.mp4` or add a `.gitkeep` file for empty folders.

**Example additions:**
```
# AI/ML model weights
*.pth
*.pt
*.ckpt

# Wav2Lip generated and cache folders
results/
temp/
checkpoints/
```

If you want, I can update your `.gitignore` with these improvements automatically. Let me know!

To ignore that file in Git, add this exact line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
realestate_agent/Wav2Lip/results/result_input_15.mp4
```

If you want Git to ignore **all `.mp4` files** in that results folder, use:

```
realestate_agent/Wav2Lip/results/*.mp4
```

If you want Git to ignore **all `.mp4` files everywhere** in the repo:

```
*.mp4
```

After updating `.gitignore`, run:

```bash
git rm --cached realestate_agent/Wav2Lip/results/result_input_15.mp4
```

so itâ€™s removed from Git tracking but stays on disk.

Do you want the `.gitignore` to exclude just **that single file**, or **all future result files** in that folder?
