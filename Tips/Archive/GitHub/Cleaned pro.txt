# Git Branch Management and Cleanup Guide

## Objective:
- Remove the old `feature/speech-recognition` branch
- Clean up Wav2Lip related files
- Create a new branch for TTS implementation using pyttsx3
- Push changes to the remote repository

## Steps Performed:

### 1. Check current branch and status
```bash
git branch
git status
```

### 2. Delete the old feature branch
```bash
git branch -D feature/speech-recognition
```

### 3. Create and switch to a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/tts-implementation
```

### 4. Stage all deleted files for commit
```bash
git add -u
```

### 5. Commit the changes
```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove Wav2Lip and related files, clean up project structure"
```

### 6. Push the new branch to remote
```bash
git push -u origin feature/tts-implementation
```

## Verification:
- Check branches: `git branch -a`
- View commit history: `git log --oneline`
- Verify remote: `git remote -v`

## Notes:
- The `-u` flag in `git push -u` (or `--set-upstream`):
  - Pushes your branch to the remote repository
  - Sets up tracking between your local branch and the remote branch
  - Allows using simpler commands in the future (just `git push` or `git pull`)
  - Only needs to be used the first time you push a new branch
  - Example: `git push -u origin feature/tts-implementation`

- The `-D` flag forces deletion of the local branch (use with caution)
- All Wav2Lip related files have been removed from version control
- The new branch `feature/tts-implementation` is now ready for TTS development

## Next Steps:
1. Set up a virtual environment (if not already done)
2. Install required packages (pyttsx3, etc.)
3. Begin implementing TTS functionality
4. Regularly commit and push your changes




git branch -D feature/speech-recognition

git checkout -b feature/tts-implementation

git status

git add -u

git commit -m "chore: remove Wav2Lip and related files, clean up project structure"


git remote -v

git push -u origin feature/tts-implementation
