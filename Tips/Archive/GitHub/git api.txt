Your GitHub API account information can be accessed using the GitHub API. For your user profile, the URL is:

```
https://api.github.com/users/<your-username>
```

For your account, replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.  
For example, for your username `zoma00`, the URL is:

```
https://api.github.com/users/zoma00
```
https://api.github.com/users/zoma00/repos

You can open this URL in your browser or use it in API requests to get your public GitHub profile data in JSON format.



Filter by name


The GitHub API does not support direct filtering by repository name in the URL. Instead, you can:

1. Fetch all your repos:
   ```
   https://api.github.com/users/zoma00/repos
   ```

2. Filter by name in your code or use a tool like `jq` or Python to process the JSON and find the repo(s) you want.

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Search API to search for a repo by name:
```
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=repo-name+user:zoma00
```
Replace `repo-name` with the name you want to search for. This will return matching repositories for your user.
