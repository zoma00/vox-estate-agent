Summary of actions to remove OpenAI key file and add pre-commit protection
Date: 2025-09-19
Branch: feature/tts-implementation

Context
- A sensitive OpenAI API key was present in several files (example: `backend/.env.backup` and `Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt`). The key was visible in the workspace attachments.
- The user indicated they manually deleted `Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt` from the repository.

What I did (chronological)
1) Verified tracked state
   - Confirmed `backend/.env.backup` was not tracked (git reported "not-tracked").
   - Searched the repo for occurrences of `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the specific `sk-proj-...` string to find other exposures.

2) Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits
   - Added entries to ignore `backend/.env`, `backend/.env.*`, top-level `.env`, and `Tips/keys/`.
   - Commit: `chore: ignore env files and local keys (prevent accidental commit of secrets)` (commit id: b61c8be)

3) Removed tracked files containing the key from the git index (kept local copies)
   - Removed the following from the index with `git rm --cached` and committed:
     - `Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt`
     - `web-frontend/webfront/React_tips/Integration steps.txt`
     - `web-frontend/webfront/React_tips/Dangling symlink venv bug.txt`
   - Commit: `chore(secrets): remove local key files from repository index` (commit id: 8652add)
   - Pushed the commits to remote branch `feature/tts-implementation`.

4) Added pre-commit protection and docs note
   - Created a simple pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` that scans staged files for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `sk-` patterns, and `.env` and blocks commits if matches are found.
   - Added `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` to copy `.githooks/pre-commit` into `.git/hooks` and make it executable.
   - Updated `docs/README.md` with a "Secrets & Git hooks" section explaining how to install the hook and best practices.
   - Commit: `chore(secrets): add pre-commit hook and install script; docs note` (commit id: 09f9e19)
   - Pushed the commits to remote branch `feature/tts-implementation` (branch updated: 8652add..09f9e19).

Commands I ran (high level)
- Search and checks:
  - `git grep -n "OPENAI_API_KEY\|sk-"`
  - `git ls-files --error-unmatch backend/.env.backup`
- Update ignore and commit:
  - Edit `.gitignore` (add `backend/.env*`, `.env`, `Tips/keys/`)
  - `git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: ignore env files and local keys (prevent accidental commit of secrets)"`
- Remove files from index and commit:
  - `git rm --cached "Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt" "web-frontend/.../Integration steps.txt" "web-frontend/.../Dangling symlink venv bug.txt"`
  - `git commit -m "chore(secrets): remove local key files from repository index"`
  - `git push origin feature/tts-implementation`
- Add hooks and docs, commit, push:
  - Created `.githooks/pre-commit` and `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`
  - `git add docs/README.md .githooks/pre-commit scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`
  - `git commit -m "chore(secrets): add pre-commit hook and install script; docs note"`
  - `git push origin feature/tts-implementation`

Verification performed
- Confirmed `git ls-files --error-unmatch "Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt"` reports not-tracked (file not tracked by git).
- Confirmed pushes completed and branch updated on remote.

Important notes & next steps (recommended)
1) Revoke the exposed key immediately via the OpenAI dashboard. I cannot revoke it for you. Revocation is essential.
2) If the secret was present in pushed commits (history), consider purging history using `git filter-repo` (recommended) or BFG. This rewrites history and requires a force push and coordination with collaborators.
   - If you want me to purge history, reply and I will prepare and run `git filter-repo` commands and force-push; be aware all collaborators must re-clone or reset their local branches.
3) Install the pre-commit hook locally to block future accidental commits:
   - From repo root:
     - `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`
4) Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production (don’t store secrets in repository files).

Local copies
- The files that were removed from the index remain on your local filesystem (they were removed from git tracking but not deleted locally). Remove them securely if desired.

If you want me to proceed with an automated history purge now, reply with `purge` and indicate whether you prefer `git-filter-repo` (recommended) or BFG.

End of summary.
I'll (1) mark the "remove .env.backup" todo completed since you've removed tracked secret files and we've already updated ignore rules, and (2) run a quick git check to confirm `Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt` is no longer tracked and show the commit that removed it. Outcome: confirmed removal and updated todo list. 

Completed (2/6) *Remove .env.backup from repo*

Ran terminal command: git ls-files --error-unmatch "Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt" && echo tracked || echo not-tracked

Got it — thanks for confirming. I checked and `Tips/keys/OpenAI key.txt` is no longer tracked by git (shows "not-tracked"). I updated the todo list to mark the removal step completed.

Quick summary and next safe steps you can take (recommended)
- Revoke the exposed key immediately in the OpenAI dashboard (if you haven't yet). This is essential even though the file is untracked now.
- If the exposed key was ever pushed to remote history (you briefly pushed before removing), consider purging history (I can run `git filter-repo` or BFG if you want). That process rewrites history and requires force-push and coordination.
- Keep using the pre-commit hook I added — run:
  - install-git-hooks.sh
  - This prevents future accidental commits that include .env or `sk-` patterns.

If you want, I can:
- Run a history purge now (I’ll prepare and run `git filter-repo` and force-push) — reply “purge” to proceed, or
- Leave history as-is and only rely on revocation + the hook (reply “no-purge”).

Which would you prefer?
