After installing the Codex extension in VS Code,
 you can find the Codex panel in the Activity Bar 
 (usually on the left side of VS Code, where you see 
 icons for Explorer, Search, Source Control, etc.). Look 
 for an icon labeled “Codex” or “OpenAI Codex.” Click it to 
 open the panel.

If you don’t see it:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to open the
 Command Palette.
- Type “Codex” or “OpenAI Codex” and select “Open Codex Panel”
 or a similar option.

Once open, you can move the panel to the right side by
 dragging its tab.

If you still can’t find it, make sure the extension is enabled and VS Code has been restarted after
 installation.
