The main differences:
------------------------

- Codex is a chat-based coding agent from OpenAI, designed for interactive code generation, 
editing, and automation. It can handle larger, multi-step coding tasks and lets you delegate 
jobs to the cloud.
- Copilot (powered by GPT-4.1) is an inline code completion tool from GitHub, giving you real-time 
code suggestions as you type in your editor.
- Codex offers a dedicated panel for conversations and task management, while Copilot works directly 
in your code files.
- Both use advanced AI models, but their user experience and workflows are different: Codex is for
 chat and complex tasks, Copilot is for quick, inline code help.
