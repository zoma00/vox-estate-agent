You can use either Codex or Copilot for a project like this. 
Codex is helpful if you want interactive, chat-based coding assistance, 
need to generate or edit large code blocks, or want to automate 
multi-step tasks. 
Copilot is better for quick, inline code suggestions as you write.

For building a creative digital campaign with AI agents, Codex can help you:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Generate code for web apps, social media automation, or avatar creation.
- Edit and refactor scripts for your campaign.
- Brainstorm and implement features through chat.

Choose Codex if you prefer a conversational, task-oriented workflow. Use Copilot for fast, 
inline code help as you develop. Both can support your project, but Codex offers more flexibility
 for complex, multi-step coding tasks.
