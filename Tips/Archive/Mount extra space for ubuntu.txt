Ah, got it 👍 You’re **dual-booting Windows 11 + Ubuntu**, and Ubuntu only has \~117 GB for everything. That’s why you keep running out of space.

You have **two options** depending on how much free space is on your Windows partitions:

---

## 🔹 Option 1: Resize partitions (permanent solution)

This means shrinking Windows’ partition and giving more space to Ubuntu.

### Steps:

1. **Check free space in Windows**

   * Boot into Windows.
   * Open **Disk Management** (`Win + X → Disk Management`).
   * Look at how much free/unallocated space you have.

2. **Shrink the Windows partition**

   * Right-click on your main Windows partition (usually `C:`).
   * Choose **Shrink Volume**.
   * Enter the amount (e.g., shrink by 50 GB).
   * This will create **unallocated space**.

3. **Boot into Ubuntu live USB**

   * Use your Ubuntu installation USB (or make a bootable one).
   * Choose *“Try Ubuntu”* (not install).
   * Open **GParted** (install with `sudo apt install gparted` if not there).

4. **Resize Ubuntu partition**

   * Find your Ubuntu root partition (`/dev/sda4` in your case).
   * Resize/move it into the **unallocated space**.
   * Apply changes.

⚠️ **Important**: Always back up data before resizing partitions — it’s safe but risky if power goes out or something crashes.

---

## 🔹 Option 2: Add a new partition and mount it

If you don’t want to resize, you can create a new partition and mount it in Ubuntu as extra space.

Example:

1. Boot Windows → Shrink volume to free up 50 GB (as unallocated).
2. Boot Ubuntu → Use GParted to format it as `ext4`.
3. Mount it somewhere useful, e.g.:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/data
   sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/data   # replace sdaX with the new partition
   ```
4. Add it permanently to `/etc/fstab` so it auto-mounts on reboot.
5. Move heavy folders (like `~/Downloads` or `~/Docker`) into that partition, and symlink them back:

   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads /mnt/data/Downloads
   ln -s /mnt/data/Downloads ~/Downloads
   ```

---

## 🔹 Option 3: External SSD / HDD

If resizing Windows is tricky, you can plug in an external SSD, format it as `ext4`, and mount it for Docker/images/projects. Works great for big AI models.

---

✅ My recommendation:
If you want Ubuntu to be your main dev machine → **Option 1 (resize)**.
If you only need extra space for projects/Docker → **Option 2 (new partition or external disk)**.

Nice 👍 `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/` looks like your extra partition (probably a Windows NTFS partition).

To check its size in Ubuntu, you can use:

### 1. With `df -h` (human-readable disk usage)

```bash
df -h /media/hazem-elbatawy/New\ Volume/
```

➡️ Shows **total size, used, available** for that partition.

---

### 2. With `lsblk` (list block devices)

```bash
lsblk -f
```

➡️ Lists all partitions with **mount points, sizes, and filesystem types**. You’ll see which device (`/dev/sdaX`) corresponds to `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/`.

---

### 3. With `du` (if you want to see folder usage inside it)

```bash
du -sh /media/hazem-elbatawy/New\ Volume/*
```

➡️ Shows how much space each top-level folder inside it takes.

---

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to **use this partition for Docker / Downloads / Projects** so Ubuntu doesn’t eat up your `/dev/sda4` space anymore?


hazem-elbatawy@hazem-elbatawy-Vostro-15-3510:~$ df -h /media/hazem-elbatawy/New\ Volume/
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda3       804G  628G  177G  79% /media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume
hazem-elbatawy@hazem-elbatawy-Vostro-15-3510:~$ 

Perfect 👍 thanks for running that.

So here’s the breakdown for your `/dev/sda3` (**New Volume**):

* **Total size**: **804 GB**
* **Used**: **628 GB**
* **Free**: **177 GB** (still quite a lot!)
* **Mounted at**: `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume`

This is most likely your **Windows data partition (NTFS)**. Ubuntu can read/write it, so you can absolutely use it to offload big files (projects, Docker data, AI models, etc.) instead of filling up `/dev/sda4` (which only has \~7 GB free).

---

✅ A smart move now is:

* Move heavy stuff like `~/Downloads`, AI models, or even `~/Docker` there.
* Symlink them back so apps don’t break. Example:

```bash
# Move Downloads to New Volume
mv ~/Downloads "/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/Downloads"

# Create a symlink so Ubuntu still finds it at ~/Downloads
ln -s "/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/Downloads" ~/Downloads
```

You can do the same for `~/Videos`, `~/Documents`, or even your `Docker` directory (`/var/lib/docker`) if you want to free massive space.

---

👉 Do you want me to prepare a **step-by-step guide to move Docker’s storage** to `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/` (so it stops eating `/dev/sda4`)? That alone could free up **20+ GB** right away.


Good catch 👌 You’re right to be cautious.

Moving Docker’s storage (`/var/lib/docker`) won’t break your **wav2lip** container/image if it’s done properly — but if you just copy things blindly, Docker won’t recognize them.

Here’s how it works:

---

## 🔹 Option 1: Safely move Docker storage to `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/`

1. **Stop Docker service**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop docker
   ```

2. **Move the current data** (so you don’t lose `wav2lip`)

   ```bash
   sudo rsync -aP /var/lib/docker "/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/docker"
   ```

   ✅ This copies all existing images, containers, volumes, etc. (including wav2lip).

3. **Rename old directory (backup)**

   ```bash
   sudo mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.old
   ```

4. **Create a symlink**

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s "/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/docker" /var/lib/docker
   ```

5. **Restart Docker**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

6. **Test wav2lip**
   Run:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   docker images
   ```

   You should still see `wav2lip` and your other containers.

7. If everything works, you can safely delete the old backup:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker.old
   ```

---

## 🔹 Option 2: Leave Docker where it is, just move other heavy stuff

If you’d rather not risk Docker, you can instead move:

* `~/Downloads`
* `~/Videos`
* AI models (`.local/share/tts/`, `~/.cache/`, etc.)

This way, Docker stays untouched and wav2lip is 100% safe.

---

👉 Question for you:
Do you want me to prepare the **Option 1 script (safe migration of Docker)** so you don’t lose wav2lip,
or should we stick with **Option 2 (move personal files/models)** and keep Docker where it is?

@###########################################################

Got it 👍 You want a **full overview** of all free space on your system.
Here are the commands you can run:

---

### 🔹 1. Disk partitions (overall free/used)

```bash
df -h
```

➡️ Shows all mounted partitions with total, used, available space.
(You already ran this before for `/` and `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/`.)

---

### 🔹 2. Block device layout (disks & partitions)

```bash
lsblk -f
```

➡️ Displays **all disks/partitions**, their sizes, filesystems, and mount points.
Good for checking where `/dev/sda3`, `/dev/sda4`, etc. are mounted.

---

### 🔹 3. Inode usage (in case space is fine but "disk full" appears)

```bash
df -i
```

➡️ Shows how many inodes are used/free (important if you have *many small files*).

---

### 🔹 4. Largest folders (to see what eats space)

```bash
sudo du -h --max-depth=1 / | sort -hr | head -n 20
```

➡️ Shows the top 20 largest directories in `/`.

---

👉 If you want, I can give you a **single script** that runs all 4 checks and prints a clean summary of:

* All partitions + free space
* Largest folders in `/`
* Inode usage
* Which partition Docker is filling

Do you want me to prepare that script for you so you just run **one command**?



Got it ✅ thanks for clarifying — we won’t touch **Docker** or your **Downloads** since they’re critical for your multi-agent project.

That leaves you with two safe paths:

---

## 🔹 Option A: Free up `/sda4` without touching Docker/Downloads

We can safely clean:

* **APT package cache**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get clean
  ```
* **Old kernels** (if any)

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
  ```
* **System journal logs** (sometimes several GB)

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=200M
  ```
* **Snap packages** (Ubuntu snaps take a lot of space)

  ```bash
  sudo du -h /var/lib/snapd/snaps | sort -hr | head -n 10
  ```

  Then remove old revisions:

  ```bash
  sudo snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' | while read pkg rev; do sudo snap remove "$pkg" --revision="$rev"; done
  ```

This should give you back several GB without touching Docker or Downloads.

---

## 🔹 Option B: Expand Ubuntu partition (`sda4`)

Since your **`sda3` (New Volume, 804 GB)** has **176 GB free**, you could:

1. Boot into **Windows** and shrink `sda3` by \~50–100 GB using **Disk Management**.
2. Boot into Ubuntu live USB → open **GParted**.
3. Expand `sda4` into the newly freed space.

⚠️ Safer but needs backup before resizing.

---

👉 Since you don’t want to move Docker or Downloads:
Do you want me to prepare a **cleanup script (Option A)** so you reclaim space now,
or should I guide you through **resizing partitions (Option B)** to give Ubuntu more total space?

so i can mount this new vol
/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/




Yes ✅ you can absolutely use **`/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/`** as extra storage inside Ubuntu.

That partition is **`/dev/sda3` (804 GB NTFS, 176 GB free)** → mounted at `/media/hazem-elbatawy/New Volume/`.

---

### 🔹 How to use it safely

* You can **store large files/projects** there (datasets, models, backups).

* You can **move non-critical folders** from Ubuntu into it and then symlink them back, for example:

  ```bash
  mv ~/Videos /media/hazem-elbatawy/New\ Volume/Videos
  ln -s /media/hazem-elbatawy/New\ Volume/Videos ~/Videos
  ```

  (So apps still see `~/Videos`, but files are stored on `New Volume`.)

* For **Docker** you said you don’t want to move it → fine. Just use this volume for *data*.

---

### 🔹 Caveats

* Since it’s **NTFS**, Linux will mount it with user permissions that may not always fit. If you hit a **"Permission denied"**, you can remount with your UID/GID.
* It’s also shared with **Windows 11**, so anything you store there is visible on both OSes. That’s handy, but be careful not to overwrite important files.

---

👉 Question:
Do you want me to show you how to **permanently mount this volume at boot** (so it’s always available in Ubuntu),
or just keep mounting it when needed manually?
