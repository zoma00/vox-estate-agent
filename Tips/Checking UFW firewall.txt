I assume you meant UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). Below are quick commands and what they show, plus safe steps to enable/disable and check defaults.

Quick checks (one-liners)
- Check whether UFW is installed:
```bash
which ufw || dpkg -l | grep -i ufw
```
- Check UFW status (human readable):
```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```
- Check status in a concise form (script-friendly):
```bash
sudo ufw status | head -n 1
# or
sudo ufw status | grep -i '^Status'
```
- Check if UFW service is running and enabled at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ufw
sudo systemctl is-enabled ufw
```

Interpreting `sudo ufw status verbose`
- `Status: active` — firewall is on and enforcing rules.
- `Status: inactive` — firewall is off.
- `Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)` — shows default policies (deny incoming by default is common/secure).

Show rules with numbers (useful for removing specific rules later):
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

Check underlying system firewall engines (in case UFW is not used)
- iptables:
```bash
sudo iptables -L -n -v
```
- nftables (newer Ubuntu versions may use nftables):
```bash
sudo nft list ruleset
```
- firewalld (unlikely on stock Ubuntu, but check):
```bash
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

Safe enable / disable workflow (important if you access the machine remotely via SSH)
1. Allow SSH before enabling UFW so you don’t lock yourself out:
```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH   # or `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`
```
2. Enable UFW:
```bash
sudo ufw enable
# Confirm status:
sudo ufw status verbose
```
3. To temporarily disable:
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

Check which ports are listening (useful to see what you need to allow):
```bash
sudo ss -tuln    # or `sudo netstat -tuln` if installed
```

Check UFW logging (if enabled) and recent events:
```bash
# enable logs (if desired)
sudo ufw logging on
# view recent logs
sudo tail -n 200 /var/log/ufw.log
# or via journalctl
sudo journalctl -u ufw --no-pager --since "1 hour ago"
```

Check default policy explicitly
```bash
sudo ufw status verbose | sed -n '1,4p'
# Or use ufw show raw to inspect
sudo ufw show raw
```

Install UFW if not present
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
```

Automation / scripting checks
- Script-friendly check that returns 0 when active:
```bash
sudo ufw status | grep -qi 'status: active'
echo "exit code: $?"
```

Notes and best practices
- Always allow SSH (or your remote access port) before enabling firewall on remote servers.
- Cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure) also have network-level firewalls/security groups that operate outside the instance — check those separately.
- UFW is a front-end for iptables/nftables; even if UFW is inactive, iptables/nftables rules may still exist (check `iptables`/`nft`).
- If you only need to confirm whether the system firewall is active, `sudo ufw status verbose` + `sudo systemctl is-enabled ufw` are usually enough.

If you want, I can:
- Run the appropriate checks on your machine right now and paste the outputs (I can run `sudo` commands if you want me to — tell me which checks to run).
- Or give exact commands to run safely on a remote server (I can provide a short script).

#############################################################

This looks good — UFW is active and explicitly allowing SSH, so you won’t be locked out.

What your output shows (brief)
- `Status: active` — UFW is enforcing rules.
- `Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing)` — conservative, secure defaults.
- Rules shown:
  - `22/tcp (OpenSSH) ALLOW IN Anywhere` (and the v6 entry) — SSH is allowed for all sources.
  - `8501 ALLOW IN Anywhere` (and v6) — port 8501 is allowed for all sources (likely a service you run, e.g., Streamlit).

If you want to tighten access (recommended if this is a remote server)
- Restrict SSH to your IP (safer than a global allow). Replace X.X.X.X with your public IP:
```bash
# add rule that only allows your IP to connect on SSH
sudo ufw allow from X.X.X.X to any port 22 proto tcp

# verify
sudo ufw status numbered
```
- Then remove the wide OpenSSH rule (use the numbered output to delete the correct rule):
```bash
# Example: if the wide OpenSSH rule is #3 (check with status numbered first)
sudo ufw delete 3
# or delete by name (less predictable if duplicates exist)
sudo ufw delete allow OpenSSH
```

To remove the port 8501 rule (if you don't want it open to the world)
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered    # find the rule number for 8501
sudo ufw delete <num>       # remove that rule
# or
sudo ufw delete allow 8501
```

Quick checks you can run now
- Confirm UFW rules:
```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```
- See rules with numbers (safer for deleting):
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```
- See which process is listening on a port (e.g., 8501):
```bash
sudo ss -tuln | grep ':8501\b' || sudo ss -tuln | grep 8501
# or
sudo lsof -i :8501
```
- Get your public IP (from that machine):
```bash
curl -s https://ifconfig.co
# or
curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip
```

Safety notes
- Always add an SSH allow rule for your IP before removing the global OpenSSH rule — otherwise you may lock yourself out.
- On cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure), also check the VM’s network security group / firewall — those operate outside the instance and must allow SSH too.
- IPv6 entries shown mean UFW is allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; if you don’t use IPv6, you can remove the v6 rules similarly.

If you want, I can:
- Give the exact commands with your public IP (paste it here), or
- Walk you through restricting SSH step-by-step (I’ll show the `status numbered` output parsing and safe delete sequence). Which would you like?

# verify
sudo ufw status numbered


##############################  to get my public ip         #################################

Quick ways to find your public IP (run from the machine)

- Using curl (recommended — simple):
```bash
curl -s https://ifconfig.co        # returns your public IP (IPv4 or IPv6)
curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip      # another popular service
curl -s https://api.ipify.org     # very small response, IPv4 or IPv6
```

- Using DNS (no external HTTP service):
```bash
# uses OpenDNS resolver
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

- Using wget if curl not installed:
```bash
wget -qO- https://ifconfig.co
```

- Cloud VM metadata endpoints (if running on a cloud VM)
```bash
# AWS
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

# GCE (Google)
curl -s "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/access-configs/0/external-ip" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"

# Azure
curl -s "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/network/interface/0/ipv4/ipAddress/0/publicIpAddress?api-version=2021-02-01" -H "Metadata:true"
```

Save to a shell variable (handy for UFW rules)
```bash
MYIP=$(curl -s https://ifconfig.co)
echo $MYIP

# then add a UFW rule allowing only your IP for SSH
sudo ufw allow from $MYIP to any port 22 proto tcp
```

Notes and caveats
- These commands contact a third-party service to report your public IP. Use the cloud metadata endpoints when on cloud VMs to avoid external calls.
- Public IP can change (dynamic ISP). If your IP changes often, consider using a dynamic DNS service or allow a range instead of a single IP.
- If you are behind a VPN or corporate NAT, the returned IP is the VPN/NAT exit IP — not your home network IP.
- If you want IPv4 specifically, some services allow flags or you can filter output; most return the appropriate IP version automatically.

Quick test from another machine
- From a different machine (e.g., your phone on mobile data or another laptop), try:
```bash
ssh username@your.public.ip
```
- If it connects, your firewall/SSH rules are correct.

If you want, I can:
- Run one of these commands for you and paste the result (tell me which command to run).
- Give the exact `ufw` command using your returned IP if you paste it here.

Created 4 todos

I'll (1) add the IP-based UFW rule using the provided public IP, (2) show the commands you should run to verify and test SSH from another device, and (3) update the todo list statuses. I won't remove the global OpenSSH rule until you confirm remote SSH works. I'll run the UFW command now. 

Ran terminal command: sudo ufw allow from 196.136.193.94 to any port 22 proto tcp && sudo ufw status numbered

Starting (2/4) *Verify and test SSH access*

Done — I added a UFW rule allowing SSH only from your public IP (196.136.193.94) and showed the numbered rules.

What I ran
- Added IP-restricted SSH allow and listed rules:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow from 196.136.193.94 to any port 22 proto tcp
  sudo ufw status numbered
  ```
- Output (relevant lines):
  - [1] 8501 ALLOW IN Anywhere
  - [2] OpenSSH ALLOW IN Anywhere
  - [3] 22/tcp ALLOW IN 196.136.193.94
  - [4] 8501 (v6) ALLOW IN Anywhere (v6)
  - [5] OpenSSH (v6) ALLOW IN Anywhere (v6)

Next recommended step (do this before deleting the global OpenSSH rule)
- From another device (or your phone using mobile data), try a fresh SSH connection:
  ```bash
  ssh yourusername@196.136.193.94
  ```
  If it connects, proceed to remove the broad OpenSSH rule.

How to remove the global OpenSSH allow (safe sequence)
1. Confirm connection works from another device.
2. Remove the numbered rule for `OpenSSH` using its index (the index may change; check `sudo ufw status numbered` again first). Example:
  ```bash
  # If OpenSSH is rule 2 (confirm with sudo ufw status numbered)
  sudo ufw delete 2
  ```
3. Verify:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status verbose
  ```

Optional: restrict or remove port 8501 if you don't want it public:
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered   # find rule index
sudo ufw delete <num>      # remove rule for 8501
# or to restrict to your IP:
sudo ufw allow from 196.136.193.94 to any port 8501 proto tcp
```

Todo update
- I updated the session todo list:
  - Added IP-based SSH allow — completed
  - Verify & test SSH access — in-progress
  - Remove global OpenSSH rule — not started

If you'd like I can:
- Wait while you test SSH from another device, then remove the global `OpenSSH` rules for you.
- Or remove the `OpenSSH` rules now (risky if you haven't tested).
Which do you want me to do next?
