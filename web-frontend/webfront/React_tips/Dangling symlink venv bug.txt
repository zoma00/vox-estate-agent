I see the issue now. The problem is that there's a dangling symlink in the app directory that's preventing the .env file from being created. Let's fix this:

First, let's remove the dangling symlink and then create a proper .env file:
bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd ~/Downloads/vox-estate-agent/backend/realestate_agent

# Remove the dangling symlink in the app directory
rm -f app/.env

# Create a new .env file with the correct content
cat > .env << 'EOL'
# OpenAI API Configuration

# Path Configuration

# Copy the .env file to the app directory
cp .env app/

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
This will:

Remove any existing symlink in the app directory
Create a new .env file with all the necessary variables
Copy it to the app directory
Start the server
The issue was that there was a broken symlink in the app directory, which was preventing the .env file from being created properly. The new commands will ensure that we have a proper .env file in both locations.

If you still encounter issues, please let me know what error message you see.
