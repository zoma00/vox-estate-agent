Understood! Since you deleted the conflicting files and successfully initialized the React app, you now have a clean React project in `web-frontend/webfront`.

Next steps:
- Add your custom frontend code (e.g., the chat UI, audio playback, API integration)
 to the new src and public folders.
- Replace the default `App.js`, `index.js`,
 and related files with your custom versions as needed.
- Update the README and documentation to reflect the new setup.

If you want, I can re-create your custom `App.jsx`, `index.jsx`, and `index.css` 
in the new React project, and help you continue with frontend development. 
Would you like me to proceed with this?
