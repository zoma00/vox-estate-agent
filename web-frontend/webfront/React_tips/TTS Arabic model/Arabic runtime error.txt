I see the issue - the frontend can't find the generated audio file. The problem is that the backend is serving files from the temp directory, but the frontend can't access it directly. Let's fix this by:

Creating a static file route in the FastAPI backend to serve the audio files
Updating the frontend to use the correct URL
Let me check the FastAPI app's main file first.

Let me check the main FastAPI application file to add a static file route for serving audio files.

I noticed that the FastAPI app is set up to serve static files from the "static" directory, but the audio files are being saved to the "temp" directory. Let's update the code to serve files from the correct directory.

I'll update the code to ensure the audio files are saved in the correct directory and properly served. Here's what needs to be done:

Create a static directory for audio files if it doesn't exist
Update the audio file path to use the static directory
Return the correct URL for the frontend
Let me make these changes:

agent_pipeline.py
+33
-11
Let's update the FastAPI main file to ensure it properly serves the static files:

main.py
+4
-3
Let's update the frontend to use the new audio URL. I'll locate the React component that handles the audio playback.

Let me check the App.js file to update the audio handling.

Let me check the SpeakChat component to update the audio handling.

Let me check the SpeakChat component to update the audio handling.

I'll update the SpeakChat component to use the new audio_url field from the API response. Here's the fix:

SpeakChat.jsx
+36
-7
I've made several important changes to fix the audio file serving issue:

Backend Changes:
Updated the audio file storage to use static/audio directory
Fixed the audio URL generation to use the correct path
Added proper error handling and logging
Ensured the static directory is properly mounted in FastAPI
Frontend Changes:
Updated the SpeakChat component to handle the new audio_url field
Added better error handling and logging for audio playback
Added a debug view that shows the audio URL for troubleshooting
Improved the audio player with error handling
File Structure:
Audio files are now stored in backend/realestate_agent/static/audio/
The files are served at /static/audio/filename.wav
To test the changes:

Restart your FastAPI server to apply the backend changes
The frontend should now be able to access the audio files at http://localhost:8000/static/audio/filename.wav
If you still encounter issues, check the browser's developer console for any error messages. The debug view in the UI will also show the exact URL being used for the audio file, which can help with troubleshooting.

Let me know if you need any adjustments or run into any other issues!
