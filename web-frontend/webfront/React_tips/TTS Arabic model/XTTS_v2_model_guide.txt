# XTTS v2 Model Guide: Location, Usage, and VPS Transfer

## What is XTTS v2?
XTTS v2 is a multilingual speech synthesis model from Coqui TTS. It supports many languages, including Arabic, and is used for generating high-quality voice output in your AI agent project.

## Where is the Model Stored?
When you download XTTS v2 using Coqui TTS, it is saved outside your main project directory, typically in your user's local data folder:

```
/home/<your-username>/snap/code/206/.local/share/tts/tts_models--multilingual--multi-dataset--xtts_v2/
```
- Main model file: `model.pth`
- License agreement: `tos_agreed.txt`

This location is managed by Coqui TTS and is not inside your project workspace (e.g., not in `backend/realestate_agent`).

## Why is it Stored Outside the Project?
- Keeps your codebase clean and lightweight
- Allows sharing the model across multiple projects
- Avoids version control issues with large files

## How to Copy the Model to a VPS
If you want to use XTTS v2 on a remote server (VPS), you can transfer the model directory to avoid re-downloading:

### 1. Find the Model Directory
```
/home/<your-username>/snap/code/206/.local/share/tts/tts_models--multilingual--multi-dataset--xtts_v2/
```

### 2. Transfer Using SCP or RSYNC
Replace `<your-vps-user>` and `<your-vps-ip>` with your VPS credentials.

**Using SCP:**
```bash
scp -r /home/<your-username>/snap/code/206/.local/share/tts/tts_models--multilingual--multi-dataset--xtts_v2 <your-vps-user>@<your-vps-ip>:/home/<your-vps-user>/.local/share/tts/
```

**Using RSYNC:**
```bash
rsync -avz /home/<your-username>/snap/code/206/.local/share/tts/tts_models--multilingual--multi-dataset--xtts_v2 <your-vps-user>@<your-vps-ip>:/home/<your-vps-user>/.local/share/tts/
```

### 3. On the VPS
- Ensure the directory structure matches what Coqui TTS expects.
- The model should be in `/home/<your-vps-user>/.local/share/tts/tts_models--multilingual--multi-dataset--xtts_v2/`
- Your TTS code will automatically find the model if the environment and TTS library are set up correctly.

## Notes
- Make sure Python, Coqui TTS, and dependencies are installed on the VPS.
- Check your license terms for non-commercial or commercial use.
- If you use a different username or home directory on the VPS, adjust the paths accordingly.

## Troubleshooting
- If TTS cannot find the model, check the path and permissions.
- Re-run the TTS download command if needed, or verify the transfer.
