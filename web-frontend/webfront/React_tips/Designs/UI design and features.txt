Absolutely! Here’s a plan for your admin dashboard UI:

**Features:**
----------------

- Overview panel (stats: total chats, TTS requests, active users)
- Recent chat history (with user/agent messages)
- Real estate property gallery (with images)
- Upload new property images
- User management (list, add, remove users)
- Settings (API keys, TTS config, etc.)

**UI Design Suggestions:**
- Use a sidebar for navigation (Dashboard, Properties, Users, Settings)
- Main area for dashboard widgets and tables
- Property gallery: grid of real estate images with add/delete buttons
- Use cards for stats and chat history
- Modern, clean look (e.g., Material UI or Ant Design)

**Next steps:**
1. Scaffold a new React component (e.g., `AdminDashboard.jsx`)
2. Add sidebar navigation and main content area
3. Add widgets for stats, chat history, and property gallery
4. Use placeholder images for real estate properties (can use Unsplash or local images)
5. Style with Material UI, Ant Design, or custom CSS

Let me know if you want to start with the basic dashboard layout,property gallery, ##

 or another feature first! 
I can generate the initial code for you.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```

```

```
Accessibility warnings are now fixed:
- Sidebar links in `AdminDashboard.jsx` are now styled buttons (no invalid hrefs).
- The unused `audioUrl` variable in `App.js` is removed.

Your code should now compile cleanly without these warnings. Let me know if you want to add navigation logic
 to the sidebar or continue with more dashboard features!



Compiled with problems:
×

The error is resolved. All references to `setAudioUrl` have been removed from `App.js`.

Your app should now compile without this ESLint error. Let me know if you want to continue with more dashboard features or UI improvements!

The background image and "Back to Home" button are now correctly implemented in your admin dashboard. You can return to the main chat landing page at http://localhost:3000/ by clicking the button.
