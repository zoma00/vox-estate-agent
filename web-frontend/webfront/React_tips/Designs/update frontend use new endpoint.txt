Hereâ€™s how to proceed with your next steps:

1. **Update your frontend to use the new endpoints:**
   - Change your API calls in React to use `/api/chat` for chat+TTS and `/api/tts` for TTS only.
   - Use `/api/languages` to fetch supported languages for dropdowns or settings.

2. **Test the API with different languages and settings:**
   - Try sending requests with `"language": "ar"` for Arabic, `"en"` for English, etc.
   - Adjust `"model"`, `"temperature"`, and `"max_tokens"` in your requests to test AI response variations.

3. **Monitor the logs in `app.log` for any issues:**
   - Check `agent_pipeline.log` (or `app.log`) for errors, warnings, and info messages.
   - Use logs to debug failed requests or unexpected behavior.
