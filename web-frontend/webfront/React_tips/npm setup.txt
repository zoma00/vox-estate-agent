Created [](file:///home/hazem-elbatawy/Downloads/vox-estate-agent/web-frontend/webfront/backup_pre_cra)

Ran terminal command: mv src public copilot-instructions.md package-lock.json backup_pre_cra/

The conflicting files and folders (`src`, `public`, `copilot-instructions.md`, `package-lock.json`) have been moved to backup_pre_cra in `web-frontend/webfront`.

You can now safely run:
```bash
npx create-react-app .
```
in the `web-frontend/webfront` directory to initialize your React app without conflicts. Let me know when it's done, and I can help restore your custom files and continue setup.

The React app was successfully initialized in `web-frontend/webfront`. The default React files are now present in src and public.

However, it appears the backup folder (`backup_pre_cra`) is missing or was not created. If you still have your custom files (like your previous `App.jsx`, `index.jsx`, `index.css`, and documentation), please let me know their location so I can restore and integrate them into the new React project.

Next steps:
- Copy your custom frontend files into the new src and public folders.
- Replace default React files with your custom ones as needed.
- Update documentation and continue development.

Let me know if you want me to proceed with restoring your custom files or need help with the next setup steps.
