srv518662293 login: 





You're almost there — the serial console shows you pasted the password at the username prompt (so it was treated as the login name). Use the username prompt for the account name (usually `root` or `ubuntu`), then paste the password only when the `Password:` prompt appears.

Follow these exact, safe steps in the xterm.js console (do not paste any passwords into chat):

1) At the `srv518662293 login:` prompt type the username and press Enter
- Try `root` first:
  - Type: root
  - Press Enter

- If the provider instructions mention a different initial user (for Ubuntu images that use a default user), try `ubuntu` or the username from the provider panel instead.

2) When you see `Password:` paste the VM password (the one shown in the provider panel)
- Paste only the password at this prompt, then press Enter.
- Tip: paste exactly the password text (no trailing spaces/newlines). If the web console auto-inserts a newline when pasting, that's okay — it should behave like typing then Enter.

3) If you get "Login incorrect" again
- Do NOT paste the password into the `login:` prompt. Instead:
  - Try the other common usernames: `root`, `ubuntu`, `debian`, or the one shown in your provider panel.
  - Confirm the password listed in the provider panel (copy it fresh).
  - Use the provider panel “Reset password” / “Reset root password” action (many control panels provide this) and then repeat step 2.

4) If the image was created to require SSH keys (password auth disabled)
- The VM may refuse password logins by design. In that case:
  - Use the provider control panel to add your SSH public key to the instance (if the provider supports it), or
  - Use the web console / rescue mode to mount the disk and add your key to `/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys`, or
  - Recreate the instance selecting “add SSH key” during creation.

5) If login succeeds — immediately run these checks (paste outputs only if you want me to parse them)
```bash
whoami
id
cat /etc/os-release
sudo journalctl -u ssh --no-pager -n 200 || sudo journalctl -u sshd --no-pager -n 200
sudo sed -n '1,240p' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo sshd -T | sed -n '1,200p'   # shows effective sshd settings
sudo tail -n 200 /var/log/auth.log || sudo tail -n 200 /var/log/secure
```

6) If you still can't log in after trying `root`/`ubuntu` and resetting the password via the provider panel:
- Use the provider’s Rescue/Recovery mode to boot a rescue image, mount the instance disk, and add your public key to `/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys` (I can give the exact rescue steps for your provider if you tell me which provider UI options you see).
- Or contact provider support if their panel shows a different initial-credentials flow.

Summary / Next step
- Try the precise flow above: type `root` at `login:`, then paste the provider password at `Password:` and press Enter.
- If that succeeds, run the verification commands in step 5 and I’ll produce the exact commands to create deploy, add your public key, and harden SSH.
- If it fails, tell me which usernames you tried and whether the provider panel offers “Reset password”, “Add SSH key”, or “Rescue mode” options — I’ll give the fastest rescue steps for that path.
