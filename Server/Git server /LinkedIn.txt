I’ll create an upbeat, recruiter-focused LinkedIn post that highlights your technical skills, impact, and availability — then give a short caption and attachment/CTA suggestions.

🚀 Building PropEstateAI — AI-powered, production-ready text-to-speech 
experiences for real estate. 

I designed and shipped an end-to-end platform that turns listing copy
 into natural, branded audio presentations using local TTS + OpenAI 
 integrations — fast, reliable, and production-first. 🎙️✨

What I built:
-----------------
- Backend: `FastAPI` + `uvicorn` serving the `realestate_agent` service ⚙️  
- Voice: custom TTS pipeline with local model options for low-latency,
 studio-quality narration 🎧  
- Intelligence: `OpenAI`-powered prompts & NLU to turn listing text into 
engaging scripts and CTAs 🤖📝  

- Deployment: server-hosted with `systemd` + `nginx`, guarded clone/venv workflow
 for safe, repeatable updates 🔁🧰

Why it matters for teams:
----------------------------
- Faster, higher-quality listing content without manual voiceovers — scalar 
impact for marketing ops 📈  
- Reproducible, secure deployments so engineering teams can move fast and sleep
 well 🛡️💤  
- Built with hiring-ready patterns (TDD-friendly, modular services, 
CI-friendly deployment) — easy to onboard and extend 👥

Hiring managers & recruiters — I’m open to roles in backend/ML engineering, 
developer-led product teams, or early-stage PropTech opportunities.
 If you’re hiring for folks who can own TTS pipelines, OpenAI integrations,
  and production deployments — let’s talk. 🤝

DM me or email: [zoma0097@gmail.com] — happy to share the repo, 
architecture diagram, and a short demo clip. 🎬

PropEstateAI — production TTS + OpenAI pipeline for real estate listings. Looking for backend/ML roles & PropTech opportunities. 🎙️🤖

Attachment & CTA suggestions
----------------------------
- Attach: 8–12s MP4 or GIF demo of the TTS output over a simple listing 
image (best engagement).  
- Alternate: short 30s demo clip (host on Drive/Vimeo) and link in the 
first comment.  
- Pin a comment with: repo link, 1–2 tech bullets, and “Open to interviews
 for backend/ML roles — DM to connect.”

Want it shortened to a 1–2 sentence headline only, or tailored to mention
 specific roles/seniority and your contact info? Tell me what to include 
 for the contact line and I’ll produce a final variant.



##############################################

I’ll polish your recruiter-focused LinkedIn post, remove the Wav2Lip mention, and add copy-ready text plus a short preview and a suggested pinned comment (for links / demo). Use your two images as the main visual assets (first image = demo screenshot, second = architecture/console).

PropEstateAI — production TTS + OpenAI pipeline for real estate listings. Open to backend/ML roles. 🎙️🤖

Suggested pinned comment (first comment, include links)
-------------------------------------------------------
Repo & demo: [repo link] • 30s demo clip: [demo link]  
Quick tech bullets: FastAPI backend • local TTS models • OpenAI prompt-engineering • systemd+nginx deployment  
Open to interviews for backend/ML roles — DM or email: zoma0097@gmail.com

Image usage & caption suggestions
---------------------------------
- Use your two images as a carousel: first image = short demo frame (avatar or waveform + listing image), second = architecture or console screenshot.  
- Captions: “Demo: 10s TTS output” and “Architecture & server logs — production-ready pipeline”.  
- When posting, add the demo link in the pinned comment (not the main post) to increase engagement.

Posting tips
------------
- Post mid-week (Tue–Thu) during business hours for best recruiter visibility.  
- Tag 1–2 relevant companies or colleagues to expand reach.  
- If you want, I can produce a shorter seniority-targeted variant (e.g., “Senior Backend/ML Engineer — available now”) or a version that lists specific technologies or a link to a hiring profile — tell me which and I’ll tailor it.

If you want, I can also paste a one-line headline variant for your profile headline or produce a version that emphasizes leadership/IC level (Senior/Staff). Which do you prefer?
