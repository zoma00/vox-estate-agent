## Project Plan

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Separate chatbot logic (OpenAI API or similar) from avatar/animation layer.
- Use Python (FastAPI) for backend logic and API endpoints.

### 2. Interactive Avatar Pipeline
- Use open-source facial animation tools (e.g., SadTalker, Wav2Lip) to animate a static avatar image with TTS audio.
- Use open-source TTS (e.g., Coqui TTS, VITS, or Google TTS API) for realistic voices.
- Combine TTS output with facial animation to generate talking head videos or real-time streams.
- For real-time web avatars, explore Three.js (JavaScript) or Unity (C#) for 3D avatars.

### 3. AI Agent Personas & Campaign
- Create unique AI agent personas with different looks and bios.
- Use your avatar pipeline to generate short, fun intro videos for each agent.
- Build a simple web app where users can interact with the agents (ask questions, get property matches, etc.).
- Collect feedback and iterate.

### 4. Development Workflow
- Use Codex or Copilot to help generate, refactor, and debug code as you build.
- Keep code modular for easy upgrades (better TTS, more realistic animation, etc.).

### 5. Deployment
- Containerize the FastAPI app with Docker for easy deployment.
- Host the app and serve the interactive avatar experience on your website.

## Notes
- This approach avoids recurring avatar/video costs and gives you full control.
- Building your own solution is technically challenging and requires knowledge of deep learning, computer vision, and real-time systems.
- Start simple (static avatar + TTS), then add animation and real-time features as you progress.

## Quick Start
1. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install requests fastapi uvicorn
   # Add dependencies for TTS and animation tools as needed
   ```
2. Generate a static avatar image (or use an existing one).
3. Use TTS to generate audio from text.
4. Use facial animation tools to animate the avatar with the TTS audio.
5. Run the FastAPI app to serve the agent and integrate with your web frontend.

# PropEstateAI

**Voice-powered AI agent for real estate automation and interaction.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
PropEstateAI is a modular, self-hosted AI agent designed for real estate applications. It features high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) using Coqui TTS, a FastAPI backend for easy integration, and a flexible architecture for future expansion (including animation and advanced AI features).

---

## ✨ Features
- Local, open-source TTS (Coqui TTS, glow-tts model)
- FastAPI backend with REST endpoints
- Modular Python codebase
- Interactive testing: type text, get audio response
- Ready for future animation and AI pipeline integration

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Coqui TTS (glow-tts)
- Bash scripting (automation)

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/propestateai.git
cd "propestateai"
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:
pip install fastapi uvicorn TTS python-multipart requests
```

---

## 🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS) Usage

- TTS is powered by Coqui TTS (glow-tts model).
- Batch and API-based synthesis supported.

#### Test TTS locally:
```bash
python realestate_agent/tts/tts_coqui.py
```

#### Run FastAPI server:
```bash
cd realestate_agent
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Test TTS API interactively:
```bash
python test_tts_api.py
# Type your text and receive a playable audio file (tts_output.wav)
```

## Secrets & Git hooks (important)

Never commit secrets (API keys, credentials, or .env files) into the repository. This project includes a sample pre-commit hook to help prevent accidental commits of files containing common secret patterns.

Quick steps for developers:

- Ensure your real keys live in environment variables or your hosting secrets manager (e.g., systemd Environment, Docker secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions secrets).
- Keep a `.env.example` in the repo with placeholder values instead of real keys.

Installing the local git hook:

1. From the repository root run:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

2. This installs a `pre-commit` hook that scans for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `sk-` patterns, and common `.env` filenames and blocks the commit if it finds matches.

If you accidentally committed secrets and pushed them to a remote, revoke the exposed key immediately and consider purging history using `git filter-repo` or BFG — see the Contributing/Operations docs for details.
