SpeakChat Enhancements â€” mobile-frontend

Summary
-------
This document lists the enhancements made to the mobile chat page (`mobile-frontend/src/pages/Chat.jsx`) to bring it in line with the web frontend's `SpeakChat.js` experience. The edits focus on usability, accessibility, and reliable audio playback for demos.

Files changed
-------------
- `mobile-frontend/src/pages/Chat.jsx` (updated)
- `mobile-frontend/src/utils/TTSService.js` (existing helper used)
- `mobile-frontend/src/styles.css` (may be updated later for visual polish)

Features added / ported
-----------------------
1. Link rendering and extraction
   - Converted plain-text URLs into clickable anchors inside messages.
   - Added `extractLinks()` to capture URLs from message text and attach a `links` array to messages so a "Helpful links" block can be rendered below agent messages.

2. Message metadata
   - Added `timestamp` for both user and agent messages so the UI shows message times.
   - Messages now include `links` and optional `audio` when the backend provides an `audio_url`.

3. Audio playback improvements
   - If the backend returns `audio_url`, the client prefers playing that URL directly.
   - For relative `audio_url` values (e.g. `/static/audio/xxx.wav`) the client rewrites them to an absolute URL using the current page protocol and hostname with port `8000` so audio plays correctly during local demos.
   - When no `audio_url` is supplied, the client falls back to `TTSService.speak()` which posts to `/api/tts` and plays the returned blob, or falls back to the Web Speech API.
   - `isSpeaking` state was added to avoid overlapping speech commands and improve UX.

4. Typing indicator
   - A lightweight typing indicator (`Typing...`) is shown while awaiting the backend response.

5. Basic speech recognition (voice input)
   - Implemented start/stop functions using the browser `SpeechRecognition` API (Chrome/Edge).
   - Recognition results are appended to the input box and recognition end triggers an auto-send if any text was captured.
   - Error handling and state (`isListening`, `error`) were added for better feedback.

6. Accessibility and UX
   - `aria-live="polite"` remains on the chat container for screen readers.
   - Play buttons include `aria-label`s. Inputs include `aria-label` and the send button is disabled appropriately to prevent duplicate sends.

Testing performed
-----------------
- Warmed up TTS on component mount (best-effort) using `TTSService.warmup()`.
- Sent a normal text query and validated the agent's reply is displayed and spoken.
- Verified playback using both a returned `audio_url` and the fallback `TTSService.speak()` behavior.
- Verified relative audio URLs are rewritten and playable when the backend runs on `localhost:8000`.
- Verified typing indicator appears while waiting for the backend.
- Tested the basic speech recognition flow in Chrome; results append to the input and auto-send occurs on recognition end.

Edge cases noted
----------------
- Large message volumes: the mobile layout limits message width; consider collapsing long messages or adding a "Read more".
- Multiple links in the same message: links render correctly but styling may need tuning for compactness.
- Recognition language: default set to `en-US`; make configurable if needed.
- Browser support: `SpeechRecognition` is not available on all browsers (Safari lacks full support). The app gracefully degrades but show a friendly message when not available.

Next steps / polish
-------------------
- Add a visible microphone button in the input area and wire it to `startListening` / `stopListening`.
- Add/update CSS rules in `mobile-frontend/src/styles.css` for `.helpful-links`, `.message-ts`, `.play-btn`, and `.typing` to match web visuals.
- Improve error messages and transient toasts (e.g., "TTS failed, using fallback").
- Add tests using `@testing-library/react` to validate message rendering and the TTS fallback path.
