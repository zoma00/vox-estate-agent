Activity summary - PropEstateAI mobile frontend

Date: 2025-09-19
Branch: feature/tts-implementation

Summary of changes made in this branch (mobile frontend area):

1) Implemented mobile chat UI
   - File: src/pages/Chat.jsx
   - Behavior: Sends user messages to `/api/chat` (POST JSON { message }), displays messages in a scrolling container, renders URLs as links, shows a typing indicator, and includes a play button to replay agent messages.
   - TTS: After receiving an agent reply, the UI calls the TTSService to play the audio.

2) Centralized TTS helper
   - File: src/utils/TTSService.js
   - Behavior: Primary TTS path: POST `/api/tts` with `{ text }`, expects audio blob and plays via an `Audio` object; fallback to the browser `speechSynthesis` API if backend TTS is unavailable.
   - Warmup: `warmup()` attempts an initial `/api/tts` call on mount (best-effort).

3) Routing and small UI scaffolding
   - Files: src/App.jsx, src/main.jsx, index.html
   - Routing: BrowserRouter with routes for `/`, `/chat`, `/gallery`.
   - Navbar component added at src/components/Navbar.jsx (basic links and Logout button placeholder).

4) Styles
   - File: src/styles.css (existing file used for layout and colors).

5) Build verification
   - Ran `npm install` and `npm run build` in `mobile-frontend` to ensure there are no syntax or build errors. Build completed successfully.

6) Notes and assumptions
   - Assumed backend endpoints are the same as the web frontend (`/api/chat` and `/api/tts`).
   - TTSService expects `/api/tts` to return an audio blob when POSTed with `{ text }`. If your backend returns `audio_url` strings instead, we can add URL rewriting logic.
   - Navbar component is included but not fully wired with `token`/`user` props; it is left as a simple presentational nav.

How to run locally (developer steps):

1) Start backend (FastAPI/uvicorn). Example (adjust as appropriate):

   uvicorn realestate_agent.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

2) Start the mobile dev server:

   cd mobile-frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev

3) Open the dev server in your browser or a device on the same LAN and navigate to `/chat`.

Next recommended tasks:
- Polish chat styles to match `web-frontend` `SpeakChat` look and animation.
- Wire Navbar with authentication state (magic-link provider) and implement guest/demo flow.
- Add tests for Chat component and TTSService (optional but recommended).

End of summary.
