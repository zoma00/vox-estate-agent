SpeakChat Fix Log — mobile-frontend

Overview
--------
This log documents the fixes and improvements applied to `mobile-frontend/src/pages/Chat.jsx` to align it with the web frontend `SpeakChat.js` and to resolve UI issues observed during testing (notably white text in the input ribbon and missing background/card layout).

Files edited
------------
- `mobile-frontend/src/pages/Chat.jsx` — added background + centered card, link rendering, timestamps, helpful links, audio playback improvements, typing indicator, and speech recognition start/stop.
- `mobile-frontend/src/styles.css` — set message and input colors, placeholder color, helpful links styling, timestamps, and button styles.

Fixes applied
-------------
1) Background and card wrapper
   - Added gradient overlay + Unsplash photo as page background to match webfront.
   - Wrapped the chat container in a centered white card with rounded corners and drop shadow for better legibility.

2) Chat text readability (messages)
   - Ensured message text inside the white card is dark (`#111`) via `.chat-container, .message-body, .chat-message` rules.
   - Set `agent` and `user` bubble backgrounds for visual separation.

3) Chat ribbon/input (white text issue)
   - Replaced the transparent input style with `background: #fff` and `color: #111` so that the input text is readable on the white card.
   - Added `::placeholder` color (`#666`) and updated submit button styling.
   - Ensured `.chat-input` aligns items to center and buttons are visible.

4) TTS & audio playback
   - Prefer `audio_url` returned by backend and rewrite relative URLs to absolute `http(s)://host:8000/...` during local testing.
   - When no audio URL returned, use `TTSService.speak()` as fallback; set `isSpeaking` state to prevent overlaps.

5) Link handling & Helpful links block
   - Implemented `extractLinks()` to attach found URLs to messages.
   - Rendered a small "Helpful links" list under agent replies when links are available.

6) Typing indicator and timestamps
   - Show a minimal "Typing..." indicator while awaiting the backend response.
   - Added `timestamp` to user and agent messages and display the time in the message bubble.

7) Speech recognition
   - Added `startListening` and `stopListening` helpers based on `window.SpeechRecognition` to append recognized text to the input and auto-send on end.
   - Added `isListening` and `error` states for UX feedback.

Testing performed
-----------------
- Ran a local CSS syntax check (no errors).
- Manual test sequence (recommended steps to reproduce):
  1. Start backend: run `uvicorn realestate_agent.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` from `backend/realestate_agent`.
  2. Start mobile frontend: from `mobile-frontend` run `npm install` (already done) then `npm run dev`.
  3. Open browser at `http://localhost:5173/` and open the Chat page.
  4. Verify card background + image is visible.
  5. Type a message and send; ensure the reply appears under agent and is read aloud. If the reply includes links, confirm the "Helpful links" block displays.
  6. Verify the input box text color is dark and placeholder is gray.
  7. (Chrome) Click the mic button (if present) to record — recognized text should append and auto-send.

Notes & edge cases
------------------
- If you still see white input text, try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear dev server cache — Vite sometimes serves cached CSS.
- Speech recognition won't work on all browsers (Safari currently lacks full support). The app will show a friendly message if unavailable.
- The absolute rewrite of `/static/audio/...` to `http(s)://host:8000/static/audio/...` is for local demo convenience; in production ensure the backend returns absolute `audio_url` values.

Next steps
----------
- Add a visible microphone UI element and wire `startListening` / `stopListening` to it.
- Polish spacing and fonts to match the webfront exactly (copy `SpeakChat.js` inline styles or move them to `styles.css`).
- Add unit tests for message rendering and TTS fallback flow.
