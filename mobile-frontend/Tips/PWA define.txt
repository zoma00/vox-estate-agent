- Add PWA support (manifest + service worker) so users can install the app.
what is pwa


Great question 🙌

**PWA** = **Progressive Web App**.

👉 It’s a **web app** (like your React build) that behaves more like a **native mobile/desktop app**:

* 📱 Users can **install it** on their home screen (without App Store/Play Store).
* 🌐 Works **offline** (using a **service worker** cache).
* ⚡ Faster loading after first visit (cached assets).
* 🔔 Can support **push notifications** (with backend setup).

### What makes a web app a PWA?

1. **`manifest.json`** → metadata about the app (name, icons, theme colors, start URL).
   Example:

   ```json
   {
     "short_name": "MyApp",
     "name": "My Awesome App",
     "icons": [
       {
         "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
         "sizes": "192x192",
         "type": "image/png"
       },
       {
         "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
         "sizes": "512x512",
         "type": "image/png"
       }
     ],
     "start_url": "/",
     "display": "standalone",
     "theme_color": "#ffffff",
     "background_color": "#ffffff"
   }
   ```

2. **Service Worker** → JS file that runs in the background, caching assets & enabling offline mode.

3. **HTTPS** → Required for PWAs (so service worker is secure).

### Example in your case

* Your React build already has `manifest.json` (in `/public`).
* Add a **service worker** (React can use `workbox` or `create-react-app`'s PWA template).
* When deployed, users visiting `example.com` on mobile will see **“Add to Home Screen”** option.

⚡ In short:
A **PWA turns your React website into something installable & offline-capable**, bridging between a normal website and a native mobile app.
