Change: Improve readability of the demo paragraph on the Home hero

Files changed:
- src/styles.css

What changed:
- Updated CSS to force the `.muted` paragraph inside `.hero-card` to be white with a dark text-shadow.

New rule added:
.hero-card .muted { color: #fff !important; text-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.85) !important; }

Reason:
- The demo paragraph sits over a background image which contains bright and varied colors. The previous dark text color and lack of shadow made the paragraph hard to read.
- White text with a strong dark shadow improves contrast and legibility across the hero image.

How to verify locally:
1. From the project folder run:
   cd mobile-frontend
   npm install   # if node_modules are not present
   npm run dev

2. Open the dev server in a browser (default Vite port): http://localhost:5173
3. Visit the Home route (`/`) and confirm the paragraph reads:
   "A demo mobile UI â€” chat with the agent, get spoken responses, and explore listings."
   It should appear white with a dark shadow.

Notes & future options:
- If you prefer avoiding `!important`, we can refactor the CSS cascade or increase selector specificity instead.
- If you want the same treatment on the web frontend, add a matching rule in `web-frontend/webfront/src` styles or update `App.js` accordingly.
