Screenshot tool run — README

What I did
1. Started the web frontend dev server (Create React App)
   - Directory: web-frontend/webfront
   - Command: `npm start`
   - Observed: server compiled successfully and served at http://localhost:3000

2. Started the mobile frontend dev server (Vite)
   - Directory: mobile-frontend
   - Command: `npm run dev`
   - Observed: Vite attempted to bind at 5173; if 5173 was in use it fell back to 5174. In my run a Vite server was reachable (I used 5173/5174 depending on availability).

3. Installed Playwright to capture screenshots
   - From repository root: `npm i -D playwright@1.55.0`
   - Installed browsers: `npx playwright install chromium`

4. Created a small Playwright script to capture screenshots
   - File: `tools/screenshot.js`
   - Script opens each URL and saves a full-page PNG to `web_home.png` and `mobile_home.png`.

5. Ran the screenshot script
   - Command: `node tools/screenshot.js`
   - Errors encountered and how I resolved them:
     - `Error: Cannot find module 'playwright'` — fixed by installing Playwright with `npm i -D playwright`.
     - `browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist` — resolved by running `npx playwright install chromium` to download the browser binary.
     - `page.goto` errors (connection refused) — caused when a dev server wasn't running or reachable; ensured both dev servers were started in their respective directories.
     - On some runs Playwright reported navigation to `chrome-error://chromewebdata/` when Vite returned an intermediate error page; restarting the Vite server fixed that.

Files produced
- `web_home.png` — screenshot of the web homepage saved to the repository root.
- `mobile_home.png` — screenshot of the mobile homepage saved to the repository root.
- `tools/screenshot.js` — Playwright screenshot script.

How to reproduce locally
1. Start each dev server in separate terminals:
   - Web (CRA):
     ```bash
     cd web-frontend/webfront
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - Mobile (Vite):
     ```bash
     cd mobile-frontend
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

2. Install Playwright and its browsers (once):
   ```bash
   cd <repo-root>
   npm i -D playwright@1.55.0
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

3. Run the screenshot script:
   ```bash
   node tools/screenshot.js
   ```

Notes and troubleshooting
- If the mobile dev server picks a fallback port (5174, 5175...), update the `tools/screenshot.js` URL list accordingly.
- If Playwright can't launch the browser, ensure `npx playwright install` completed successfully and that the cache directory (e.g., `~/.cache/ms-playwright`) has the browser binaries.
- If the CRA server fails to start, ensure you're running `npm start` from `web-frontend/webfront` (not repository root).

- If you want me to re-run the screenshots after further UI tweaks, tell me and I will capture new images.
