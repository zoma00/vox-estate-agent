# TTS Cleanup Report

## Performed on: 2025-09-17

## Removed Files
1. `backend/realestate_agent/tts/tts_coqui.py`
   - Old Coqui TTS implementation
   - Reason: Replaced with a more lightweight solution

2. `backend/realestate_agent/tts/test_tts.py`
   - Old test file for Coqui TTS
   - Reason: No longer needed with the new implementation

3. `backend/realestate_agent/tts/test_timing.py`
   - Timing tests for the old TTS
   - Reason: Related to the removed Coqui TTS

## Current TTS Implementation
- File: `backend/realestate_agent/tts/tts_simple.py`
- Type: Lightweight gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- Benefits:
  - Faster response times
  - Lower resource usage
  - Simpler maintenance
  - Multiple language support

## Next Steps
1. The new implementation is already integrated with the application
2. No further action is required unless you want to customize the TTS behavior
3. Refer to `lightweight_tts_guide.txt` for usage and API documentation

## Verification
- The application should now be more responsive
- TTS functionality should work with the new implementation
- No dependencies on the old Coqui TTS remain
