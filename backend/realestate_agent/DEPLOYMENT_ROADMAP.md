# Fullstack Deployment Roadmap: vox-estate-agent

This guide outlines the steps to take your project from a working CLI/backend to a full production web/mobile app.

---

## 1. Develop the Frontend Locally

- **For Web:**
  - Use React.js (recommended: create-react-app, Next.js, or Vite)
- **For Mobile:**
  - Use React Native (for Android/iOS)
- **Integration:**
  - Connect your frontend to your FastAPI backend using HTTP API calls (e.g., fetch, axios)

## 2. Test Everything Locally

- Ensure your frontend can communicate with your FastAPI backend and trigger the Wav2Lip pipeline via the CLI/API.
- Test all user flows and error handling.

## 3. Prepare for Deployment

- **VPS Hosting:**
  - Subscribe to a VPS provider (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, Hetzner, etc.)
- **Domain Name:**
  - Purchase a domain for your app.
- **Backend Setup:**
  - Deploy your FastAPI backend and Dockerized Wav2Lip pipeline on the VPS.
- **Frontend Deployment:**
  - For React web: Deploy using Nginx, Vercel, Netlify, or similar.
  - For React Native: Build and publish to Google Play Store and/or Apple App Store.

## 4. Go Live

- Point your domain to your VPS or frontend hosting provider.
- Test your app on the web and mobile devices.
- Monitor logs and user feedback for any issues.

## Tips
- Use environment variables for API URLs and secrets.
- Secure your backend (HTTPS, CORS, authentication as needed).
- Automate deployment with CI/CD if possible.
- Document your API endpoints for frontend integration.

This roadmap will help you move from a working backend/CLI to a fully deployed, user-facing product on web and mobile!
