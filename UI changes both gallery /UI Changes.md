Gallery customizations (web + mobile)

Date: 2025-09-20
Branch: feature/tts-implementation

Summary
-------
This document describes the UI changes and code edits applied to the Gallery page in both the web frontend (`web-frontend/webfront`) and the mobile frontend (`mobile-frontend`). The goal was to make gallery cards show a thumbnail image inside a white card box (like the web screenshot), improve mobile readability, and use local fallback images for reliable rendering during development.

Files changed (high level)
-------------------------
- web frontend
  - `web-frontend/webfront/src/Gallery.jsx` (component updates)
  - `web-frontend/webfront/src/Gallery.css` (CSS updates to style thumbnails, overlays, cards)
  - public assets used (served from `web-frontend/webfront/public/`):
    - `photo-1582407947304-fd86f028f716.avif`
    - `real-estate-buildings-in-modern-city-akg75n64dxflm7dk.jpg`

- mobile frontend
  - `mobile-frontend/src/pages/Gallery.jsx` (new card-based gallery component)
  - `mobile-frontend/src/styles.css` (gallery + card styles added)
  - public assets used (served from `mobile-frontend/public/assets/`):
    - `photo-1582407947304-fd86f028f716.avif`
    - `real-estate-buildings-in-modern-city-akg75n64dxflm7dk.jpg`

What I changed (web frontend)
-----------------------------
1. Replace CSS `background-image` approach with an `<img>` inside the card box
   - File: `web-frontend/webfront/src/Gallery.jsx`
   - Before: images were applied via `style={{ backgroundImage: `url(...)` }}` on a `.property-image` element which visually sat behind the card content in some layouts.
   - After: each card now contains a `.property-image-container` with an `<img>` element (object-fit: cover) so the thumbnail is rendered inside the white card box.
   - Benefits: more predictable sizing, better cross-browser behavior, easier `onError` fallback handling.

2. Default to local public images for thumbnails
   - File: `web-frontend/webfront/src/Gallery.jsx`
   - Implementation: the `<img>` now uses the two local public images by index (even/odd):
     - `/photo-1582407947304-fd86f028f716.avif` and
     - `/real-estate-buildings-in-modern-city-akg75n64dxflm7dk.jpg`
   - A small `onError` handler falls back to the AVIF image if the resource fails to load.
   - Rationale: prevents blank/very dark thumbnails during development when remote image URLs are slow/unavailable, and matches the visual comps you provided.

3. CSS updates for thumbnail and price overlay
   - File: `web-frontend/webfront/src/Gallery.css`
   - Added rules for `.property-image-container img { object-fit: cover; }` and moved price overlay selector to `.property-image-container .property-price` so the price badge sits on top of the thumbnail inside the card.
   - Maintained existing responsive rules and hover behavior.

What I changed (mobile frontend)
--------------------------------
1. Replaced the placeholder route and simple text with a card-based gallery
   - File: `mobile-frontend/src/pages/Gallery.jsx`
   - New layout: hero (`Featured Properties`) + `.properties-grid` with `.prop-card` items. Each card has a thumbnail `<img>`, title, location, badges (area/beds/baths), price button and a source link.
   - Accessibility: thumbnails use `alt` attributes; headings have `id` attributes and are referenced by `aria-labelledby` on the card.

2. CSS rules to mirror the web aesthetic
   - File: `mobile-frontend/src/styles.css`
   - Added `.properties-grid` (responsive 3/2/1 columns depending on viewport), `.prop-card` (white background, shadow, rounded corners), `.prop-thumb img { object-fit: cover }`, badges, `.btn` and `.link-btn` styles.
   - Adjusted hero and heading sizes for mobile responsiveness.

3. Used local public images for thumbnails
   - The cards use the same local images available under `mobile-frontend/public/assets/`.
   - `onError` handler is present on thumbnails to fall back to the AVIF.

Why these changes
-----------------
- Putting the thumbnail inside the white card box makes the gallery look consistent and avoids the large dark empty areas when the background-image URL fails to load.
- Using local public images as defaults/fallbacks makes the dev server stable and visually predictable during development and demos.
- `object-fit: cover` provides consistent cropping and responsive behavior across devices.

How to verify locally
---------------------
1. Web frontend (Create React App):
   - cd `web-frontend/webfront`
   - `npm start`
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/gallery` and confirm cards show thumbnails inside white cards, with the price badge overlaying the bottom-right of the thumbnail and the card content below it.

2. Mobile frontend (Vite):
   - cd `mobile-frontend`
   - `npm run dev`
   - Open the Vite URL and navigate to `/gallery` (for example `http://localhost:5173/gallery`) and confirm the hero and cards render similarly to the web screenshot.

Edge cases and notes
--------------------
- Currently the web gallery forces local images (cycled by index) to ensure consistent visuals. If you'd rather use the real `property.coverPhoto.url` when available, I can change the logic to prefer the property-provided URL and fall back to these local assets only when missing.
- If you have per-property images that must map to specific cards, provide a small mapping or let me wire the actual `coverPhoto.url` back in with fallback logic.
- For production, consider using lazy-loading + low-res blur placeholders and a CDN for images.

Suggested next improvements
---------------------------
- Wire each card `View Details` to a property details route and pass an identifier to fetch full data.
- Replace placeholder local assets with real property images stored in a proper CDN or cloud storage.
- Add unit/visual tests (React Testing Library and Playwright) that assert the grid renders thumbnails and the price overlays.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Revert to using `property.coverPhoto.url` when present and fall back to local images only when missing.
- Run Playwright to capture screenshots of both `/gallery` pages (web + mobile) and attach them.
- Map specific images to specific properties if you provide a mapping or image list.
